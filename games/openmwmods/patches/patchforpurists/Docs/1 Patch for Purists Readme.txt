============
Description
============
Patch for Purists is an unofficial patch for The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind Game of the Year Edition that aims to make the game completely bug-free (within the abilities of TESCS). In addition to being under active development, it diverges from later versions of the community patches in that it takes a more conservative approach about what it considers a bug, and tries to avoiding unnecessary changes.

An overview of the fixes can be found in the Version History.


=============
Requirements
=============
Morrowind, Tribunal, and Bloodmoon


=============
Installation
=============
First of all you must update to the latest offical patch (v1.6.1820). Steam and GOG versions of the game are up to date. If you are running the CD version of the game, the correct installation order is: Morrowind / Tribunal / Bloodmoon / Bloodmoon Patch v1.6.1820. When you are in doubt about the version of your game; this can be found at the bottom left of the main menu of the game.

Next place the files in this download into your "Morrowind\Data Files" folder and overwrite files. The default location is "C:\Program Files\Bethesda Softworks\Morrowind\Data Files". For Steam users it is "C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\Morrowind\Data Files".

For some fixes to work you have to check two specific options in the Morrowind Code Patch (MCP). Under the "Mod specific" tab select the following:
"Separate axe inventory sounds"
"Creature voiceover enable"

Apply the chosen patches in MCP (You can do this at any time and it doesn't matter if you patched your Morrowind.exe before).

Activate "Patch for Purists.esm" (and optional modules to your liking under "Data Files" in your Morrowind launcher, and you're good to go.

Note: I strongly advise against updating (or switching) patches halfway through. Patches simply touches too many things, and even Wrye Mash can not repair your save in most cases. My advice is to continue playing your old save on the older patch, and update the moment you start a new playthrough. This does not apply to the small "hotfixes" updates (fixes in the patch itself) however. These can be recognized by a change in the third digit (e.g. updating from v3.1.0 to v3.1.2). The version numbering scheme works as follows: <major revision>.<minor revision>.<hotfix>


==================
Compatibilities
==================
Highly recommended to use alongside Patch for Purists:
    Morrowind Code Patch
    Morrowind Optimization Patch
    Expansion Delay﻿


Patch for Purists is compatible with the OpenMW engine but will conflict with other fan patches, namely:
    Unofficial Morrowind Patch (UMP)
    Morrowind Patch Project (MPP)
    Morrowind Rebirth (comes with its own fixes)
    Script Improvements
    GOTY Script Tidy
