Version: 4.0.2


Version 4.0.0 Update
--------------------------------------

BUG    There are two Ring of Surroundings in game. One that you get given for killing the bad people in Balmora, and one in a chest in Dren Plantation. The ring is clearly classed as a unique artifact item (a.o. Famed Artifacts of Tamriel).
FIX    Removed the one from Dren Plantation as Varro's reward seems like its intended purpose.

BUG	Alit does not have “Alit Bite” spell like the Diseased and Blighted variants.
FIX	Corrected

BUG	Resist Paralysis should cost 2.00 just like the other resist spells.
FIX	|0.20| ==> |2.00|

BUG	While all scrolls weight 0.20, the following four weigh 1.00:
	Messenger Scroll
	Milyn Faram's Scroll
	Scroll of Daerir's Blessing
	Scroll of Divine Intervention
FIX	|1.00| ==> |0.20|

BUG	While all notes weight 0.20, the following two weigh 1.00:
	Note to Hrisskar
	Note to Malsa Ules
FIX	|1.00| ==> |0.20|


Version 3.1.2 Update
--------------------------------------

BUG	The Apprentice's Probe probe weight is inconsistent among all thieves' tools.
FIX	|1.00| ==> |0.25|


Version 3.1.0 Update
--------------------------------------

BUG	Page from History of the Empire, Note from Bugrol, Note to Amaya and Ravila Memorial weighs nothing.
FIX	Weight 0.10.

BUG	Paper weighs 1.00.
FIX	Weight 0.10.


Version 3.0.3 Update
--------------------------------------

BUG	The enchant capacity of the Ebony Staff is absurd.
FIX	Reduced the enchant capacity to 14 like other unique Ebony Staffs (from 90).


Version 3.0.0 Update
--------------------------------------

BUG	In the main game (and the Bloodmoon expansion) all botanical ingredients have a weight of 0.10. However, the botanical ingredients that Tribunal introduced were ten times as heavy (1.00 weight).
FIX	Corrected the weigth of the following ingredients:
	Golden Sedge Flowers
	Horn Lily Bulb
	Lloramor Spines
	Meadow Rye
	Nirthfly Stalks
	Noble Sedge Flowers
	Scrib Cabbage
	Sweetpulp
	Timsa-Come-By Flowers

BUG	Wrapped Corprusmeat Hunk (ingred_6th_corprusmeat_04) weighs nothing.
FIX	Gave it weigth 0.50.

BUG	The properties of the Expensive Shirt in the Tribunal expansion (Expensive_shirt_Mournhold) don't match its counterparts in the base game. Probably because its numbers are just placeholders (all 1's).
FIX	Corrected the weigth, value and enchant properties.
