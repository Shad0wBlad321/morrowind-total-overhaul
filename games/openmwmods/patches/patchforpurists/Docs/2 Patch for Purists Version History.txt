PfP Fixes

- Milyn Faram's Odirniran topic is fixed... again.
- Fixed some Bosmer crime related voiced greetings.

BUG	In the quest House Redoran: Armor Repair Debts (HR_BillCollect), once you get the gold from Giras Indaram, you can keep talking to him over and over again and he keeps giving you 2000g.
FIX	Corrected.

								 Patch for Purists v4.0.1 patch notes [June 28th, 2020]
========================================================================================================================

~~~
PfP Fixes

- The patch date should no longer conflict with the games .esm files.
- Cleaned the patch some more.
- Added Imperial female weather greetings I overlooked.
- Fixed Buckmoth Fort and Pelagiad signs formatting I missed.
- Resolved some changes not taken over to the optionl modules.
- Removed the previously added "LegionUniform" script from the Imperial Dragonscale Cuirass and Imperial Newtscale Cuirass. There's not really anything in the game to indicate that it is used or intended as a Legion Uniform, they have Imperial in the name because that's just the style, like Nordic Ringmail.


BUG	The "Blessings of the Fourth Corner" spell from the statue of Sheogorath in Ald Daedroth grants Fortify Willpower for 14400 seconds instead of 1440 seconds (like it does for the other 3 stats). 
FIX	Corrected.

BUG	"SadriFight" script does not work as intended because NPCs will not equip arrows that are added to their inventory if they currently have a bow equipped with no arrows. Therefore, if Golena Sadri fires the one PoisonGrip Arrow she spawns with and it does not paralyze the player, she will be stuck firing a bow with no arrows equipped forever. She will not switch to her melee weapon because she will have arrows in her inventory that are not equipped.
FIX	Tweaked the script.

Topic=Kogoruhn: |southwest| ==> |southeast|

								 Patch for Purists v4.0.0 patch notes [June 11th, 2020]
========================================================================================================================

This update I have taken a good look at the dialogue system and fixed hundreds of bugs in its filtering. A large number of text and voiced dialogue were blocked due to faulty filtering and never actually seen in game. I also tweaked some things like healers no longer suggesting to find a healer; House Telvanni and Mages Guild members will no longer use intolerant Voiced Hello Greetings towards vampires for the sake of lore (and ingame NPC behaviour) consistency; Male Sleepers will now approaching you at night with voice lines that were previously unavailable; implemented "creature attack" lines (CrAtk_) that were simply missing for most races. Not all these fixes were documented given the scale of this undertaking. I will look into creating a comparison sheet where changes can easily be compared to the vanilla game data.

I implemented some unused voice lines  to fill gaps in the voice lists (e.g. when Bethesda used the same sound file twice):
	k\m\Atk_KM014.mp3
	a\f\Hit_AF013.mp3
	a\f\Hit_AF015.mp3
	r\f\Hit_RF007.mp3
	i\f\Hlo_IF081a.mp3
	n\f\bIdl_NF023.mp3

PfP Fixes

- Yagrum Bagarn should no longer have ugly looking behaviour caused by a previous fix (giving him Wander AI package so that he plays his Idles).
- The scripts responsible for handling cursed items have been optimized and implemented in such a way that they do not edit the original items anymore.
- Made the fix for Foeburner use burning touch_en enchantment instead of cruel firebloom_en. A melee weapons with area effect enchantment was not a good idea as it also hit friendly NPC. The new enchantment (which is also used by Last Rites and Fireblade) seems like the ideal enchantment for Foeburner. It needed a strong enchantment because of its low base stats. Now the damage output is at a similar level as the regular Dwarven Claymore.
- Tweaked the fixed viatrix_petilia script so that the journal will now only update to stage 130 on her death when the quest is active and not yet finished.
- The UMP re-filtered Edd Theman's "chores" dialogue so you needed to be a Master in House Telvanni before he'll do chores for you, but you hire him as a Wizard. This is perhaps to prevent him from doing chores before he becomes your Mouth. You should be able to send him chores as soon as he becomes your Mouth, which you could originally do. The dialogue is now filtered for the journal entry HT_RecruitEddie and not rank.
- Feather Shield, Shield of Light and Velothi's Shield now have correct bodypart models.
- Every unofficial Morrowind patch up till now made the "I could kill that guar. Those boots are ruined."  line show up 30% of the time for female Dunmer and 20% for male Dunmer. I choose to make the line show up 10% of the time for both (making sure the slave line will not occurring more often). I think that's the best way fix both Bethesda's incorrect filtering and the high frequency of these lines in fan made patches.
- Replaced the previous fixes for corpses with fly sounds attached underwater with a fix that edits the Sound_Flies script. I used to replace the corpses with ones with no sound, but the script will no use a Tribunal script function to check  whenever it is underwater and should play sounds or not. This way I don have to edit cells anymore. This would potentially also catch any mods that add fly corpses underwater as well.
- Giras Indaram should no longer give the player infinite amount of gold.
- Updated Galbedir script so that her moving back to her original position is no longer linked to any quest progression.
- The female appearance for Steel Cuirass should work correctly now.
- Eltonbrand should be obtainable again. The "blueScript" was also optimized.
- Removed unnecessary script syntax error fixes introduced in version 3.2.0.
- Redid and removed some unnecessary stuff from the UMP patch base.
- Improved the Almalexia's dialogue in the topic "missing Hand" topic by putting the choices in correct order, and removing the option for protection against paralysis (which should have never been introduced by the patch).
- The change to the Flamemirror Robe (4380 ==> 438 gold) was removed from the optional module since its enchantments are significantly stronger than its Frostmirror, Poisonmirror, and Shockmirror Robe counterparts.


~~~
General Fixes

BUG	Unlike the other items on Imperial Cult altars, the gold in the bowls is not always owned.
FIX	Fixed the cases in Fort Buckmoth, Fort Darius, Fort Moonmoth, and Fort Pelagiad.

BUG	The two Fighters Guild guards in Ebonheart, East Empire South Warehouse should have their AI Alarm set to 90 (just like the North Warehouse). In addition, the DoorMarker should be moved so you can no longer get stuck in the stool.
FIX	Corrected.

BUG	There two cases of NPC in robes standing next to Imperial Cult Altars without being assigned to the Imperial Cult faction.
FIX	Assigned both Vala Catraso the priestess and Letreius Muco the healer to the Imperial Cult faction.

BUG	The hammock in Sethan's Tradehouse in Tel Branora was missing its Global Variable making it illegal to sleep in even after renting the room.
FIX	Added Rent_TelBran_Sethan.

BUG	Several of books and a pile of gold are lacking ownership in Baladas's main room in Gnisis, Arvs-Drelen.
FIX	Corrected.

BUG	Temple shrines are free for members of the rank of Initiate or higher, but there is still a dialogue box popping up if you are willing to pay 0 gold.
FIX	Made the script skip over this question when there is no need to pay.

BUG	There is a weird head BUG going on when turning into a werewolf using Hircine's Ring while being a vampire.
FIX	Removed the ability to turn into a werewolf-vampire hybrid as Bloodmoon official patch notes state: "Turning into a vampire and werewolf at the same time using Hircine's Ring [...] is not possible now."

BUG Some of the containers in Bols Indalen's room (Dunmer smith in Mournhold, Craftsmen's Hall) are owned by the unrelated Alusaron (Redguard smith in Vivec, Foreign Quarter Plaza).
FIX Gave Bols Indalen ownership to the Small Chest, Basket and Drawers. Some of these containers could potentially spawn weapons which could make Alusaron think you stole them from him, preventing the player to sell the item in question.

BUG	One of the responses for the "mace of molag bal" topic has the condition "item mace of molag bal_unique >= 0" that is always true.
FIX	|item mace of molag bal_unique >= 0| ==> |item mace of molag bal_unique >= 1|

BUG	One of the responses for the "barilzar's mazed band" topic has the condition "item mazed_band >= 0" that is always true.
FIX	|item mazed_band >= 0| ==> |item mazed_band > 0|

BUG	If you happen upon Nels Llendo on the road before you visit Pelagiad he will be placed too close to another NPC when you first arrive in the Halfway Tavern. Apart from looking awkward, it makes selecting him a pain.
FIX	Moved him to the corner.

BUG	A banner in Molag Mar, Redoran Stronghold has ownership, resulting in a crime when activated.
FIX	Removed the ownership.

BUG	Bloodmoon has an unorthodox way of using ammo leveled lists within some leveled lists, resulting in random loot often containing exactly one arrow or bolt.
FIX	Removed "l_n_wpn_missle" from the "bm_chest_loot_01" and "bm_random_nordictomb" leveled lists and added "l_n_wpn_missle" separate to the four containers that use these leveled lists (bm_dungeonloot_barrel, bm_dungeonloot_chest, bm_nordictomb_01, bm_nordictomb_02) in stacks of 15 like similar containers on Vvardenfell do (e.g. de_r_chest_01_gav, crate_01_guardtower).

BUG	There is a corpse (contain_corpse10_silent) located in Vivec, Hlaalu Underworks and it contains a key which opens a nearby chest. That's all well and good, but Bethesda in their infinite wisdom decided, rather than creating new corpses, to copy/paste this same one repeatedly in other locations throughout the game. This means that the player will randomly find corpses carrying a key to a chest halfway across the world and have no idea what it's for, probably spending hours searching for a hidden chest and never finding one.
FIX	Attached a simple script (PfP_contain_corpse10_silent_Fix) to the corpse that removes the key when not in Vivec, Hlaalu Underworks.

BUG	Arrille claims to sell various potions and Scrolls of Divine Intervention, but he doesn't.
FIX	Gave him two restocking ones for each variant.

BUG	There are several places in Suran (Desele's House of Earthly Delights, Ranosa Gilvayn: Outfitter, and Suran Tradehouse) where attacking someone and stealing is not a crime.
FIX	Gave the curators proper Alarm AI.

BUG	Saruse Hloran, a Redoran warrior in Vivec, carries 20 Chitin Short Bows and 1 Chitin Arrow.
FIX	Corrected.

BUG Urshamusa Rapli, Wise Woman of the Ahemmusa Camp, is supposed to stay under the shell instead of going way around wherever.
FIX Set her weird Wander AI Distance: 2000 to 0.

BUG	Some Barbarians don't equip their assigned light armor.
FIX	Adjusted their skills so that they will actually wear it.


~~~
Quest Fixes

BUG	During the "Yagrum Bagarn and Wraithguard" (CX_BackPath) quest, Yagrum does not actually take Kagrenac's Journal and Planbook from you when he says "I'll take them and study them" during the Yagrum Bagarn and Wraithguard quest. The journal also states this.
FIX	Made him take the books by removing them from the players inventory and adding them to Yagrum's.

BUG Yagrum Bagarn's responses for the "Kagrenac's Journals" ("I don't know where the journals might be.") and "Kagrenac's Planbook" ("I don't know where the planbook might be.") should not be shown after bringing them to him.
FIX Corrected.

BUG If your reputation is 30 or higher, Yagrum Bagarn's dialogue skips to the point where he agrees to help, thanks to a missing "choice" condition.
FIX Corrected.

BUG After finishing Anhassi's hit on Daren Adryn in Gnaar Mok during the "Ahnassi, a Special Friend" (Journal Romance_Ahnassi) quest, it was possible to skip her extravagant shirt and pants reward by selecting "share a care" before "share a gift". You were also not able to get the dialogue/journal entry regarding the Redoran Treasury key in this scenario.
FIX Corrected by making Anhassi's dialogue that start of the search for J'Dhannar check for Romance_Ahnassi >= 50 instead of Romance_Ahnassi >= 45. This also enables her to say "Ahnassi thanks you again and again." after taking care of Daren Adryn. Previously, this dialogue was not visible because it was overruled by the wrong dialogue filter.

BUG	There are some problems with the "Tul's Escape" (MV_FakeSlave) quest. First, Tul never actually starts attacking Sterdecan when you decide to walk away from the situation. Secondly, quest stage 110 is never met because of a missing journal update for the scenario in which Sterdecan is already dead.
FIX	Corrected.

BUG	The journal entries for the "Silent Pilgrimage" (TT_SanctusShrine) quest refer to the Sanctus Shrine being in Dagon Fel but Sanctus Shrine is not in Dagon Fel.
FIX	|in Dagon Fel| ==> |west of Dagon Fel|
	|waters of Dagon Fel| ==> |waters of Sheogorad|

BUG	"The Drunken Bounty Hunter" (MV_BountyHunter) quest. Dranas Sarathram talks about mentioning Haj-Ei's name even when he hasn't .
FIX	Corrected.

BUG	When you have finished the "Gateway Ghost" (town_Sadrith) quest, you can keep boosting the disposition of House Telvanni members in town indefinitely (until 70 or higher) by keep mentioning the Gateway haunting topic.
FIX	Filtered the topic for 50 disposition.

BUG	The B6_HlaaluBook quest is named "Hlaalu Hortator" but has little to do with the actual "Hlaalu Hortator" quest.
FIX	Removed the quest name so the quest no longer shows up in the journal (they now just act like regular journal notes).

BUG	Non-House Redoran players get stuck in the "Delyna Mandas in Tel Fyr" (HR_RansomMandas) quest after being told to get to Delyna's father Arethan Mandas through Athyn Sarethi. Athyn Sarethi only suggests to speak with Arethan's father, Llerar Mandas in Ebonheart in the House Redoran part of the quest (this quest is actually two quests combined into one). Even if you did find Llerar Mandas on your own, he won't talk about the "Delyna Mandas" topic. Since Llerar Mandas is the one who rewards you for rescuing his granddaughter and finishes this quest, this quest would be stuck in your journal forever.
FIX	Copied Athyn Sarethi's dialogue about suggesting to speak with Llerar Mandas in Ebonheart for the non-Redoran part of this quest and made it enable the "Delyna Mandas" topic. Made Arethan Mandas dialogue for returning the locket ("My daughter. Where...bear to know!") check for Journal HR_MadMilk >=10 to prevent non-Redoran players picking up on the House Redoran: The Mad Lord of Milk (HR_MadMilk) quest out of nowhere. Removed the "House Redoran" part from the Delyna Mandas in Tel Fyr (HR_RansomMandas) quest name.

BUG	If you complete the "Manwe's Dues" (Mages Guild) quest by killing Manwe, the journal says Ranis still took the money from you but in reality she doesn't.
FIX	Made Ranis take the money from the player.

BUG	In the "Bad Actor" (EB_Actor) quest, if you accept the quest from Miun-Gei, and then talk to someone about latest rumors and get the 'Crassius Curio is the only one putting on a new play' rumor (EB_Actor = 50) before talking to Marcel Maurard, he'll have no dialogue about it.
FIX	Filtering Marcel's greeting for EB_actor <= 50.

BUG	You will not be able to start the miscellaneous quest Estate Sale after completing the A Show of Power quest and before completing The Mad God (i.e. while there are ash storms in Mournhold) as Geon Auline's greeting will be replaced with a generic one regarding the ash storm.
FIX	Added "Not ID Geon Auline = 1" check to the generic ash storms greetings.

BUG	In the quest "New Clothes" (HT_TheranaClothes), Felisa Ulessen promises you 1000 gold for delivering the skirt to Therana. But when you finish the quest, she only pays you 500 and says she owes you 500, not 1000.
FIX	Changed her initial promises to 500 gold, simply because it required the fewest edits.

BUG During the "Juicedaw Ring" (FG_DebtOrc) quest Lorbumol gro-Aglakh's initial dialogue upon selecting "orders" tells you to go talk to Ranes Ienith. He does eventually give you the correct target when you select the "Juicedaw Feather Ring" topic, but it's an obvious error to have him tell you at first to go talk to Ranes Ienith (who hostile from the moment you encounter him).
FIX Change Lorbumol's incorrect instructions to direct you to Lar gro-Shagramph right away as the journal suggests.

BUG	It is possible to unlock the "False Incarnate" topic by progressing through the main quest, but this is also a topic that starts of the "False Incarnate" (TT_FalseIncarnate) quest given by Tuls Valen in the Ald'ruhn Temple without extra checks. He's clearly supposed to give you the "False Incarnate" quest after you ask him about "duties" once you've done the "Compassion" quest. This is when his "False Incarnate" topic is supposed to unlock.
FIX	Made the dialogue check for "TT_Compassion >= 100".

BUG	"Rescue Joncis Dalomax" (IL_RescueKnight) quest. If you are not with the Imperial Legion when you break into Ashurnibibi, Joncis Dalomax will not give you any clue about what to do to close the quest.
FIX	Made a new journal index 60 (direct copy of 50) for non-Legion members that ends the quest after freeing Joncis Dalomax of his captors. However, you will still be able to turn in the quest at Imsin the Dreamer both as legionary and as non-Legion member.

BUG	"Rescue Joncis Dalomax" (IL_RescueKnight) quest. If you are not a member of the Imperial Legion, and happen to kill Dalomax (or get him killed), Imsin the Dreamer will "kick you out" of the faction you don't actually belong to if you talk to her about the "Joncis Dalomax" topic. Her dialogue will always be in venting-about-Dalomax mode after that.
FIX	Filtered her dialogue correctly for "Journal IL_RescueKnight >= 10".

BUG	In the Imperial Cult quest "The Haunting" (IC16_Haunting) Kaye says he's given you 200 drakes to buy a enchanted weapon or spell but you aren't given the money.
FIX	Corrected.

BUG	Nerile Andaren will give infinite Potions of Cure Common Disease if you get the "Cure Disease potion" topic in the later stages of the "Crimson Plague" (MS_CrimsonPlague) quest.
FIX	Filtered her response correctly for "MS_CrimsonPlague < 20"

BUG	"Crimson Plague" (MS_CrimsonPlague) quest. The intent of the script “PlagueAthelyn” is disable that NPC after you inform Nerile Andaren. But that never happens.
FIX	Corrected.

BUG	"Crimson Plague" (MS_CrimsonPlague) quest. The High Ordinator script intent is to disable him after you've informed Shunari Eye-Fly that you successfully killed Gedna Relvel. That never happens.
FIX	Corrected.

BUG	"The Museum" (MS_Museum) quest never finishes, even if you bring Torasa all the artifacts on the list.
FIX	Removed the quest name journal check so the index behaves like a regular journal comment.

BUG If you free Jon Hawker in Nammu, even if you never joined the Imperial Cult, the quest "Ring in Darkness" (IC25_JonHawker_free ) will be updated.
FIX Unticked the Quest Name of the side quest IC25_JonHawker_free to avoid updates in the "Ring in Darkness" Quest.

BUG Even if you never joined the Imperial Cult, when freeing Ama Nin in Berandas Underground, the quest "Boots of the Apostle" will be updated.
FIX Unticked the the Quest Name of the side quest IC26_AmaNin_free.

BUG Even if you never joined the Imperial Cult, when freeing Adusamsi Assurnarairan in Rotheran Arena, the quest "Ice Blade of the Monarch" (IC27_Oracle_A) will be updated.
FIX Unticked the Quest Name of the side quest IC27_Oracle_A.

BUG	The "Mehra Milo and the Lost Prophecies" (A2_4_MiloGone) quest has some "side quests" journal updates which make it impossible to finish, leaving the quest stuck in the player’s journal.
FIX	Unticked the the Quest Name of the side quests A2_4_Milo_hola_go, A2_4_MiloCaiusGone, A2_4_MiloGone_books, A2_4_MiloPrisonSafe.

BUG	After failing “The Ristaag” (BM_BearHunt1) or completing “Disrupt the Skaal Hunt” (BM_BearHunt2), you can get a update when getting the “Heart of the Spirit Bear” from the corpse, even if you are doing the Werewolf version of the Quest.
FIX	Now the bearheartScript requires The Ristaag has started and not failed.

BUG	After rescuing J'Saddha, the Khajiit will stand on the harbor forever.
FIX	Made "jsaddhaScript" disable J'Saddha after reporting to Ilmeni Dren the success of the quest.

BUG	The Redoran quest "Duel of Honor" (HR_CowardDisgrace) put Rothis Nethan and Brethas Deras fighting in the Vivec Arena. If you never met Brethas Deras before the duel starts, his script will begin inactive. In the case of Rothis winning the duel the game will not register unless you reload the save or reenter the Arena.
FIX	Simplified the quest since the player must have met Rothis to even get to this point. Deleted "brerasScript" since it's the unreliable one and did it all from "rothisScript".

BUG	Vanilla game allows anyone to "Rescue Madura Seran" (IL_RescuePilgrim) but the journal does not give any clue about how to end it. If you close the quest with General Darius all his previous quests will be skipped.
FIX	Now the quest is Imperial Legion only. Made the "MaduraFollow" script disable Madura Seran until the player receive the orders from Darius. The topic “Ald Velothi” for the cell “Ald Velothi” ("It's been quiet...to rescue her.") only shows when the quest starts.

BUG	When you enter the Underground Stream inside the Gnisis Mine you'll find the Ghost of Mansilamat Vabdas. He can't talk to you until you get the Widow Vabdas' Deed (IL_WidowLand) quest.
FIX	Rewrote the script “vabdasGhostScript” to disable the ghost before the quest starts and after the quest is finished.

BUG	Even if you decided not to help Lucan Ostorius deliver his shipment during the Weapon Delivery (MV_ThiefTrader) quest, he will attack you as soon as you leave Ald'ruhn and return.
FIX	If you refuse the quest the "lucan_ostorius" script will stop itself.

BUG	There's no official quest names for the two sanguine items Eno Hlaalu asks for directly, Belt of Sanguine Fleetness (MT_S_Fleetness) and Ring of Sanguine Sublime Wisdom (MT_S_Sublime), and their journal entries cannot be found in the journal's quest list.
FIX	Added quest names (Morag Tong: Belt of Sanguine Fleetness & Morag Tong: Ring of Sanguine Sublime Wisdom) and checked Finished state for the 100 Indexes.

BUG	When Reeh-Jah dies during the "The Runaway" (MV_RunawaySlave) quest, the journal doesn't update even though a journal entry and script exist for this scenario.
FIX	Rewrote the "reeh_jahScript" script to function properly. Also made sure the journal won't longer update on Reeh-Jah's dead when you refused to help him.

BUG	During the "Huleen's Hut" (MG_Apprentice) quest when you talk to Listien Bierles, after killing the Scamp, the journal should only update when you are a member of the Mages Guild.
FIX	Made his greeting check for "Journal MG_Apprentice >= 10".

BUG	"balyn omavel-DEAD" should have no script attached because it could update the journal to Mephala's Quest (DA_Mephala) index 55 ("While trying to get into Balyn Omavel's house, he spotted me. The Morag Tong will not be pleased.").
FIX	Corrected.

BUG	The player could get the Recovering Cloudcleaver (MV_AbusedHealer) quest log with no actual journal entries attached to it because Hlormar Wine-Sot's greeting will
put you at put you at Journal "MV_AbusedHealer" 1 (which is never defined).
FIX	Corrected.

BUG	Imare, Nalcarya of White Haven, and Tyermaillin should only use their unique response to the "South Wall" topic during the Master of Security (TG_BalmoraDefenses) quest.
FIX	Filtered dialogue correctly for "TG_BalmoraDefenses >= 10" and "TG_BalmoraDefenses < 50".

BUG If you kill the scamp and then talk to Edwinna about "Huleen's hut" (MG_Apprentice) before completing the quest "A Potion from Skink-in-Tree's-Shade" (MG_Potion), Edwinna will next ask you to Return Chimarvamidium (even though you never stole it), and Skink-in-Tree's Shade's quests will never be available to you, as he will always tell you he cannot give you duties until he finishes making the potion for Edwinna.
FIX Filtered two of Edwinna's responses for "Journal MG_StealBook >= 100".

BUG	In "The Death of Ralen Hlaalo" (HH_Retaliation) quest the player is rewarded by Nileno Dorvayn for killing either Nine-Toes or Thanelen Velas, even before anyone can draw any logical connection between them and Hlaalo's murder.
FIX	Made the dialogue check for both associated rumors. "30 >= HH_Retaliation" for Nine-Toes and "50 >= HH_Retaliation" for Thanelen Velas.

BUG If you complete the "Mudan-Mul Egg Mine" (HT_MineCure) quest before the "Cure Blight" (HT_CureBlight) quest, Andil won't give the correct response for the "Cure Blight" topic, making the quest unfinishable.
FIX Filtered one of the responses ("Now that the...need for my potions.") for "Journal HT_CureBlight != 10" and "Journal HT_CureBlight != 40" to make sure it won't block the active quest.

BUG An Invisible Son (EB_Invisible) quest. The journal is never updated to stage 130 from Cassius Olcinius' greetings. Lucretinaus Olcinius response for the "debt money topic" ("Cassius did what...will do sometimes.") is missing a "Journal EB_Invisible >= 60" filter (the only scenario in which he can know his son had commissioned a spell).
FIX Corrected. Filtered Cassius' other greeting accordingly. Made journal stage 130 to 120 to prevent that the father from giving endless rewards. Made a copy of the new stage 120 (125) so that Lucretinaus Olcinius can distinguish whether you have paid  his sons debt out of your own pocket or not, and base his reward on that. This was probably why Bethesda removed the journal stage 130 update. This way you can complete the quest without intervention from the father, but you can still get his reward afterwards.


~~~
Creature Fixes

BUG There are three creatures in the game (Ascended Sleepers, Hunger, Vivec) that don't have unique sounds assigned to them. This causes them to either use Alit sounds or Werewolf ones, when Bloodmoon is installed. 
FIX Ascended Sleepers are assigned their own unique sounds which existed in the game files. Vivec is assigned one of his unused sounds (viv_hit1.mp3). There was no better solution for Hunger then to assign them Alit sounds because they don't have their own sounds. This should at least ensure them to not use Werewolf sounds anymore.

BUG Three unique Ascended Sleepers (Dagoth Reler, Uvil, and Ulen) were meant to engage in a dialogue with the player (ForceGreeting in Result box) but never did because of their AI settings.
FIX Prevented them from being immediately hostile by setting their Fight to 50 and their Hello to 100 (like Dagoth Reler already had). This way they will actually greet you. Since they each had two unique greetings, I chose to make them hostile the second time you speak to them. Except for Dagoth Uvil, because his second greeting specifically states that you should make the first move ("I'm a sportsman. I'll give you a fighting chance. Go ahead. Make the first move.").

BUG So here is an interesting one. Skeleton Archers drop 60 Iron Arrows and 50 magical arrows (l_m_wpn_missle_arrow) on death. Quorn (MPP curator) changed this to 50 non-magical arrows from another levelled list and removed the magical arrows altogether. This results in a big nerf to the Skeleton Archers attacking power. My understanding is that actual problem here is that the concerning leveled list (l_m_wpn_missle_arrow) is missing results for when the player character is level 1. All other levelled lists for magical weaponry seems to follow this pattern of a non-magical (Chitin) version for when the player is level 1. The 60 non-magical Iron Arrows are possibly a workaround after Bethesda realised Skeleton Archers were not able to attack a level 1 player. This is especially problematic for several NPC who were assigned this leveled list and do not have melee weapons.
FIX Instead of adding Iron Arrows directly to the Skeleton Archers' inventory (and the above-mentioned NPC), I decided to solve the problem in its core. I added Iron Arrows as the level 1 result from the l_m_wpn_missle_arrow levelled list. Although one could make the argument of adding Chitin Arrows instead, I see no good enough reason for deviating from the choice Bethesda made.

BUG Skeleton Champion (skeleton champion, skeleton_relvel) and Greater Skeleton Champion (bm_sk_champ_bloodskal01, bm_sk_champ_bloodskal02) can spawn with no weapon because the "random_silver_weapon" leveled list is missing results for when the player character is level 1.
FIX Made the Silver Dagger appear on level 1 (instead of 2).

BUG	Several named Dagoths have wrongly assigned (non-functional) Services functions. They act as a merchants after you cast Calm on them. They have no dialogue, no goods to sell (except for their 6th House Amulet and heart which they are supposed to drop on death) and no gold with which to buy anything. Only their repair services can be taken advantage of. Some Dagoths are also missing AI Packages (Dagoth Gares, Dagoth Tureynul, Dagoth Uthol) causing them to stand in one place with no idle animations whatsoever.
FIX	Removed the Services functions and added Wander AI Packages with 0 Distance to the ones missing an AI Packages.

BUG	Some Ash Ghouls (ash_ghoul, dagoth girer, dagoth delnus, dagoth baler, dagoth ralas, dagoth fervas) talk about Dagoth Gares' death in their greetings ("For our fallen brother, we claim our revenge.") even when he is still alive.
FIX	Since these Ash Ghouls have but only two Greetings (first being filtered for "Talked to PC = 0"), filtering the second one for "Dead dagoth gares = 1" would result in strange behavior when attempting to talk to them for a second time, while Dagoth Gares is still alive (they would technically have no greeting available). To maintain vanilla behavior (in the case you did kill Dagoth Gares before attempting to speak to an Ash Ghoul), I decided to make a copy of the first greeting ("What? What use...must be destroyed.") and put this between the existing ones and filter this one for "Dead dagoth gares = 0".

BUG	Two "h2o_all_lev+2" spawns in Sheogorad Region (6,23) 50682, -191875, 1602 spawn slaughterfish and dreugh on land.
FIX	Replaced the spawns with two "ex_shore_cliffracer_lev+2" (common spawn for this area) on the exact same position.

BUG	There is a "h2o_slaughterfish" spawn in Ald Sotha (6,-9) 55032, -68268, -566 spawning a slaughterfish underground.
FIX	Removed the spawn to prevent combat music from playing. I could have chosen to move him into the water but here is already a slaughterfish there.


~~~
Magic and Enchantment Fixes

BUG	Both Bound Battle Axe and Bound Cuirass use Restoration sound effects.
FIX	Assigned Conjuration sound effects.

BUG	Summon Bonewolf is labelled as Alteration spell and uses a deviant particle texture.
FIX	Made it Conjuration and assigned the regular Summon particle texture.

BUG	"Strong Heal Companion" spell is set to work on Self instead of Touch (healing others).
FIX	Corrected.

BUG	Fire Shield has a red icon despite it being an Alteration (purple) effect.
FIX	Made a purple variant of the icon.


~~~
Item Fixes

BUG Bloodmoon introduced new sets of gloves that are all simply named "Right Glove" and "Left Glove". Most bracers/gauntlets/gloves follow the "<Material> <Left/Right> <Bracer/Gauntlet/Glove>" convention. An advantage of this convention is that in the inventory window left and right variations of the same material/style are next to each other.
FIX BM_Nordic01_gloveL: |Left Glove| ==> |Nordic Left Glove|
	BM_Nordic01_gloveR: |Right Glove| ==> |Nordic Right Glove|
	BM_Nordic02_gloveL: |Left Glove| ==> |Nordic Left Glove|
	BM_Nordic02_gloveR: |Right Glove| ==> |Nordic Right Glove|
	BM_Wool01_gloveL: |Left Glove| ==> |Wool Left Glove|
	BM_Wool01_gloveR: |Right Glove| ==> |Wool Right Glove|
	BM_Wool02_gloveL: |Left Glove| ==> |Wool Left Glove| 
	BM_Wool02_gloveR: |Right Glove| ==> |Wool Right Glove|

BUG	Helseth's unique robe shares the same name as the generic Frostguard Robe.
FIX	Helseth's robe: |Frostguard Robe| ==> |Helseth's Robe|

BUG	Spelling error.
FIX	zenithar_whispers: |Zenithar Whispers| ==> |Zenithar's Whispers|

BUG	Enamor is a Steel Dagger in game, but the CS refers to it as glass_dagger_enamor. Moreover, this blade has the stats of a Glass Dagger and belongs to a Buoyant Armiger, who are known to favor the rich ornaments of Glass.
FIX	Made it appear as Glass Dagger.


~~~
Text and Dialogue Fixes

BUG	The 92 weather specific Voice Greetings were only heard under very specific circumstances ingame, or in certain cases too often ("Think it'll rain?" line said by guards) because of bad dialogue filtering.
FIX	Now there is a 5% chance to be met by these greetings when Disposition is 50 or higher. Basically how Bethesda filtered newly added dialogue in the expansions.

BUG The "latest rumor" about Larrius Varro ("Everyone knows the...he can do.") blocks other Balmora rumors because of missing "Journal town_balmora = 0" check. 
FIX Corrected.

BUG The "latest rumor" about Larrius Varro ( "The Legion Champion...through the system.") blocks other Balmora rumors because of missing "Journal town_balmora < 5" check.
FIX	Corrected.

BUG The "latest rumor" about completing Larrius Varro quest ("They say someone...don't think so.") blocks other Balmora rumors.
FIX Corrected by filtering it for "Global Random100 < 8".

BUG	The Balmora "latest rumors" about Orvas Dren ("Everyone knows who...suits Orvas Dren.") should be filtered "Global Random100 < 40" (instead of 30).
FIX	Corrected.

BUG	The Imperial Legion rumor for Balmora ("I hear there's...to break the law.") should probably be filtered for the nearby Fort Moonmoth since there are no Legion members in Balmora and the NPCs at the fort have just one generic rumor.
FIX	Corrected.

BUG The Imperial Legion rumor for Ald'ruhn ("It's the law ...it's the law.") should probably be filtered for the nearby Buckmoth Legion Fort since there are no Legion members in Ald'ruhn and the NPCs at the fort have just one generic rumor.
FIX Corrected.

BUG Seven Vivec rumors specified for Foreign Quarter, Redoran and Hlaalu cantons are never seen (except one) because of their low positioning in the dialogue tree.
FIX Corrected.

BUG The "latest rumor" about the mysterious killings ("What could kill...just the same way?") blocks other Vivec rumors because of missing Journal town_Vivec = 0 check.
FIX	Corrected.

BUG The "latest rumor" about the mysterious killings ("Have you heard?...NEED special help.") blocks other Vivec rumors because of missing "Journal town_Vivec < 5" check.
FIX	Corrected.

BUG	The rumor about Balen Andrano ("I've heard that...lot of business.") is blocking other Vivec, Foreign Quarter rumors because of a missing "Journal EB_Bone 10" update.
FIX	Corrected.

BUG	The rumors about Miun-Gei ("I've heard that...earn a drake." & "I've heard that...earn a drake.") are blocking other Vivec rumors because of missing "Journal EB_Actor 10" update.
FIX	Corrected.

BUG	The generic rumor for Ebonheart ("With all the ...protect the Emperor.") is blocking the ones specified for the Imperial Legion and Imperial Cult about the Twin Lamps ("I hear there's...break the law.").
FIX	Filtered the former so that it won't be said by Legion or Cult members.

BUG The generic rumors for Pelagiad are blocking the one specified for the Imperial Legion ("It's the law...it's the law.").
FIX Corrected.

BUG	The Caldera rumor about Odral Helvi ("Odral Helvi was...mainland, awaiting trial.") should be filtered for "Random100 <= 33" instead of "Random100 <= 90", otherwise it will overrule the rumor about House Redoran ("House Redoran is...you mark my words.").
FIX	Corrected.

BUG One of the Caldera greetings ("People like you...out of Caldera?") is incorrectly filtered for "Random100 < 60" instead of "Random100 < 50", causing there to a  10% seeing this message, regardless of your disposition.
FIX Corrected. Now it will only be shown when the NPC disposition is below 20.

BUG	Seyda Neen has little advice ("You can read...stands to reason.", "Where to start...perks are worthwhile.") filtered for Trader class while the only trader in town (Arrille) is actually of the Trader Service class. 
FIX	Removed the class filter since Arrille has his own little advice. Filtered the former for no specific class and the latter for Commoner class. Seyda Neen's little advice dialogue tree seems to alternate between Commoner class and no class entries. Also added the missing PCLevel <2 to the latter that was mentioned in Bethesda's comments.

BUG The second Maar Gan little advice ("Visit the Tower...against a Daedra?") is never shown because it is filtered for "Random100 <30" instead of "Random100 <75".
FIX Corrected.

BUG The second Gnaar Mok little advice ("A fellow looking...trouble in town, anyway.") is never shown because the the foregoing one is filtered for "Random100  <75" instead of "Random100 <30".
FIX Corrected.

BUG The Dark Elf little advice about how Telvanni BUG musk makes even an Orc charming ("If all it...an Orc charming.") is filtered for "Not Race Orc = 1". However, this filter is meant for NPC, not the player race. It should therefore filter for "Global PCRace != 8".
FIX Corrected.

BUG Only one of the four little secrets for Fort Frostmoth was ever shown because they all lacked any proper filtering.
FIX Corrected.

BUG The Erabenimsun Camp Ashlanders little secret about Nchuleftingth ("Do the old...filled with wonders.") is missing ShowMap Nchuleftingth results like other Ashlanders little secrets have.
FIX Corrected.

BUG The Dark Elf female little secret about the most dangerous places in Morrowind ("What are the...pretty bad, too.") is never shown because the foregoing one is filtered for "Random100  <50" instead of "Random100 <30".
FIX Corrected.

BUG	There is a dialogue block of four entries under the little secret topic (starting with "You're an outlander...are dangerous places.") that have filters that make little sense and block themself and other responses because of this.
FIX	|Global Random100 <50| ==> |Global Random100 <30| (3x)
	|Sex: Female| ==> |Sex: Male| (for the cited one)

BUG The Dark Elf female "little secret" about vampires ("In Morrowind, we...They're too dangerous.") should be filtered for "Random100 <10" instead of "Random100 <20". Otherwise, it would block the Dark Elf female little secret below it.
FIX Corrected.

BUG The Thieves Guild "little advice" ("Keep a good...no one is around.") should be filtered for "Random100 <55" instead of  "Random100 <50".
FIX Corrected.

BUG	The "little secret" about Larrius Varro in Balmora ("Somebody said Larrius Varro...know what about.") blocked the other Balmora little secret bout Ordinators burning down a camp of Nerevarine cult worshippers would be blocked until after finishing Larrius Varro's quest.
FIX	Made the dialogue check for "Journal town_balmora < 10" instead of "Journal town_balmora < 30".

BUG	There's a "little advice" that Estirdalin at the Balmora Mages Guild is good to talk to about the mage trade, but she doesn't appear to have any dialogue about it because the magic school topics are filtered for Mages Guild Savants (there aren't any Savants in the Mages Guild).
FIX	Bounds all magic school topics (including unarmored) to Mage Service class. Also removed the odd "NotRace Dark Elf" filters.

BUG	The my trade topic for Herders should only be said by Ashlanders but is also said by several non-Ashlander NPC.
FIX	Filtered the topic for Ashlanders only (others will use the generic response for this topic now).

BUG	Darius shouldn't refer to himself in the Knights' little advice about Dumbuk gro-Bolak ("My notion of...trade, and Vvardenfell.")
FIX	Corrected.

BUG	Arille in Seyda Neen mentions having several potions for sale in dialogue but doesn't actually sell them.
FIX	Added Bargain (the cheapest kind) versions of the potions to his inventory.

BUG	Anja Swift-Sailer in Dagon Fel has a key (Anja's Key) which does not unlock her house (which no other key will do either). Since there are no (locked) chests in her home it is save to assume the key was meant for the door to her house.
FIX	Made the key functional.

BUG	Imperial Guards in Ebonheart have weird background responses like "I am Guard, Guard and Spearman of the Imperial Legion.", because of their unique IDs.
FIX	Copied the regular background dialogue for Imperial Guards and filtered it for Class: Guard, Faction: Imperial Legion, Cell: Ebonheart.

BUG	Some shopkeepers allow you to steal all of their stock without getting a bounty except some verbal abuse bacause of 0 Alarm AI setting.
FIX	Gave the following NPC Alarm 30: Mossanon, Mevel Fererus, Tervur Braven, Ferele Athram, Heifnir, Rathal Barus, Alarvyne Indalas, Dunel Saryon, Orns Omaren, Dranas Sarathram, Ranosa, Gilvayn.

BUG Thirteen out of eighteen named Ash Ghouls are missing dialogue. This is strange because even the generic Ash Ghouls (ash_ghoul) spawned from levelled lists share their dialogue.
FIX Corrected. Also filtered their Dagoth Ur topic ("He will not...show you mercy.") for "Journal C3_DestroyDagoth < 50" so it will no longer come up after having dealt with Dagoth Ur.

BUG	The Reflect part of the The Ring of Equity enchantment is ignored because it is always overridden by the 100% Spell Absorption.
FIX	Reversed the order of the enchantment.

BUG	Two gondoliers in Vivec have the wrong list of destinations in dialogue. Talsi Uvayn lists Fendryn Delvi's list of destinations and vice-versa. Talsi's placement is also slightly off in regards to the other Gondoliers throughout Vivec. Most of them are placed directly next to their respective docks on the right side. Talsi stands a fair distance away from her dock and is almost facing the wall, which looks quite strange for an NPC that never moves.
FIX	Switched their destinations dialogue and fixed Talsi Uvayn's position.

BUG	Helviane Desele and Ashumanu Eraishah sell Moon Sugar and Skooma but will refuse to deal with you if you have any.
FIX	Added exceptions for them to the Service Refusal dialogue.

BUG	Vatollia Apo will hand over the Gnisis Egg Mine Key even if you have been expelled from the Legion.
FIX	Made his dialogue check for "PC Expelled = 0". Also filtered his other Eggmine topic dialogue correctly for Legion members because previously he would talk to you as if you were not a member.

BUG	Legion NPCs still ask why you are out of uniform after you’ve been expelled ("You're out of...when you're serious."). The same goes for one of the reponses for the Imperial Legion topics ("For the glory...in its service.").
FIX	Made the text Greeting check for "PC Expelled = 0".

BUG	Some Temple dialogue entries for the Almalexia, Buoyant Armigers, Ministry of Truth, Sotha Sil, Temple, Tribunal, Tribunal Temple and Vivec topics are missing a "Not Local NoLore = 0" filter.
FIX	Corrected.

BUG	"You do not know? %Name was sure..." should have the Race: Khajiit condition (there's another entry below this one for non-Khajiit).
FIX	Corrected.

BUG	The early Imperial Legion quest, in which you try to get the land deed from Widow Vabdas, also unlocked a "land deed" topic for Dondos Driler and Baren Alen which is only meant for the Hlaalu Stronghold quest.
FIX	Added corrected filtering.

BUG	You can ask various NPCs about "disturbing dreams" before actually having them.
FIX	Filtered the topic correctly for "A1_Dreams >= 1".

BUG	Ajira shouldn't talk about herself in the "bet with Galbedir" topic ("They've been...thieves than Bosmer." & "It doesn't surprise me.")
FIX	Filtered dialogue correctly for "Not ID ajira  = 1".

BUG	The Ald'ruhn rumor about people getting mad because of abandoning the Temple ("Madness is a...greed and wickedness.") should only be said by Dunmer.
FIX	Corrected.

BUG	A little advice response for Mages refers to Estirdalin, the Altmer mage lady in Balmora's Guild, as a he.
FIX	Corrected.

BUG	If you've done "The Silver Bowl" quest you'll notice that Ygfa's greeting always asks you to join the Imperial Cult even after you've already joined. This was caused by her correct greeting being far down the list.
FIX	Moved the greeting and removed the "Journal MS_Piernette >= 100" and "PC Rank Layman" filters.

BUG	Lalatia Varian should not talk about herself in the Imperial Cult "little adice" topic ("The services required...powerful, well-equipped adventurers.").
FIX	Filtered dialogue correctly for "Not ID Lalatia Varian".

BUG	The "my trade" topic for monks ("I am a monk...others in my skills.") should not be said by Odral Helvi.
FIX	Filtered dialogue correctly for "Not ID odral helvi = 1".

BUG	The Khuul "latest rumors" ("Some strange men...Tight-lipped, suspicious bunch.") should probably not be said by NPC inside Thongar's Tradehouse.
FIX	Filtered dialogue correctly for "Not Cell Khull, Thongar's Tradehouse != 1".

BUG	The Caldera "latest rumors" ("House Redoran is...mark my words.") should probably not be said by NPC inside Caldera, Governor's Hall.
FIX	Filtered dialogue correctly for "Not Cell Caldera, Governor's Hall != 1".

BUG	The Balmora "latest rumors" about guards being concerned ("They say someone...don't think so.") should not be said by the guards themself.
FIX	Filtered dialogue correctly for "Not Class Guard = 1".

BUG The Pelagiad "Imperial cult" topic ("Pelagiad's Imperial cult...sells cure potions.") should not be said by Ygfa. 
FIX Filtered dialogue correctly for "Not ID ygfa = 1".

BUG	There are some mistakes in the Summon Magic Effect descriptions. The ones for Skeletal and Greater Bonewalker mistakely state that they are summoned "from Oblivion" instead of "from the Outer Realms" (like other undead). In case of Centurion Sphere the "from Oblivion" part should be completely removed (like the summons Verminous Fabricant discription). The Verminous Fabricant description should be lowercased for the sake of uniformity.
FIX	Corrected.

BUG	Two responses for the "bad people" ("If the bad...be the Smith.") and "price on your head" ("If there's a...for a price.") topics were missing "Not Local NoLore = 0" dialogue filter.
FIX	Corrected.

BUG	Rararyn Radarys' unique response to the "latest rumors" topic ("The Hlaalu and...Odirniran for years.") is shown, even when he is "possessed" as a Sleeper at night.
FIX	Filtered the dialogue to only show beteen 6.00 a.m. and 6.00 p.m. (basically when sleeperScript doesn't kick in).

- Updated the fixes for Telvanni doors so that they no longer conflict with texture replacers.

General Fixes

BUG	Many voice greetings are never heard ingame because they are blocked by bad dialogue filtering.
FIX	Corrected filtering for all Idle voice greetings. The Faction and rank acknowledging voice greetings that came with the Tribunal expansion are made availble on Vvardenfell. Fixed some Hello voice greetings (these will be expanded on in a later update).

BUG	Faction and rank acknowledging voice greetings are not available on Vvardenfell (these came with Tribunal expansion).
FIX	Corrected.

BUG	"random_imp_armor" Item Levelled List contains a subrecord for an "imperial cuirass" object but this object doesn't exist.
FIX	Changed the armor object to "imperial cuirass_armor", which does exist. A Body Part with an ID of "imperial cuirass" exists so I assume that was mistakenly used for the offending object subrecord.


~~~
Item Fixes

BUG	Foeburner seems consistent with the other named Dwemer weapons for it to have an enchantment, but it doesn't.
FIX	Gave it the unnused cruel firebloom_en enchantment (5-8 Fire Damage with an area of 20) since the name kind of implies a fire enchantment.


~~~
Creature Fixes

BUG	Staada (the Golden Saint) is set as a Creature instead of a Daedra.
FIX	Corrected.


~~~
Quest Fixes

BUG	A Man and His Guar (MV_RichTrader) quest. Journal entry 20 and Teris Raledran's introducing dialogue should mention 200 septims instead of 100. Not only does this contradict entries 100 and 105; it is also what Teris Raledran actually pays you after successfully escorting him and Rollie to Vivec.
FIX	Corrected.

BUG	Non-Redoran characters could get the Find Beden Giladren quest by going straight to the Mila-Nipal camp but cannot turn in the quest or clear the journal entry.
FIX	The quest is now exclusive to Redoran members since the journal entries don't indicate a non-Redoran completion ("I should report back to Lloros Sarano in Ald'ruhn"). The unused journal index 50 was also restored. A new script disables Beden Giladren before Lloros Sarano give his orders and after freeing him. The two rumors about the kidnap are now filtered for this quest.

BUG	Hircine's Hunt (BM_WildHunt) quest  isn't advancing to index 40 when meeting Carius, blocking getting entry 55 when reaching the gate as a result.
FIX	Corrected.

BUG	Morag Tong: Grandmaster quest. Journal entry 100 is skipped when you chose to become Grandmaster of the Morag Tong by killing Eno Hlaalu.
FIX	Added proper journal updates to Eno Hlaalu's script.

BUG	Shashev's Key (VA_Shashev) quest. The topic info "someone killed#2811024839205246927" has three conditions with one that is never true; "Item key_shashev < 0". The response should be triggered if the player returns to Sirilonwe after killing Shashev but without the key that should be taken off Shashev's corpse.
FIX	Changes the condition to "Item key_shashev = 0".

BUG	Shashev's Key (VA_Shashev) quest. Shashev's body can disappear with his key making the quest impossible to finish.
FIX	Made Shashev's corpse persist.

BUG	The duties response from Lloros Sarano ("Several Redoran soldiers...happened in Andasreth.") checks for "Journal HR_FindGiladren >= 100" instead of "Journal HR_FindTharen >= 100".
FIX	|Journal HR_FindGiladren >= 100|==>|Journal HR_FindTharen >= 100|

BUG	If you speak to Nuleno Tedas about the Urshilaku Camp prior to being on the Meet Sul-Matuul quest, it will advance Caius' dialogue past initiation.
FIX	Added a "Journal A2_1_MeetSulMatuul >= 1" check to Nuleno Tedas' dialogue.

BUG	Divayth Fyr's "Dwemer piece" topic choices have wrong checks which can cause a dialogue loop when the PC carries more than one Dwemer Coherer.
FIX	|Item misc_dwrv_artifact50 = 1| ==> |Item misc_dwrv_artifact50 >= 1|

BUG	Journal "MS_Warlords" contains a duplicate subrecord with an index of "0".
FIX	Removed the incorrect subrecord.

BUG	A Friend in Deed (EB_Deed) quest. Alusaron's second Greeting 5 ("Welcome to my...competition these days.") should check "Journal EB_Deed <= 10" instead of "Journal EB_Deed = 0".
FIX	Corrected.

BUG	Hircine's Hunt quest (BM_WildHunt) isn't advancing to index 40 when meeting Carius, blocking getting entry 55 when reaching the gate as a result.
FIX	Corrected.



~~~
Text Fixes

BUG	The background topic on the Imperial Archers reads: "I am Imperial Archer, Archer."
FIX	Gave them a dedicated one based on the Imperial guard one: "I am an Imperial archer."

BUG	Mirisa's response for topic info "service refusal#23295123702187725686" is empty.
FIX	Gave her an appropriate response made up from vanilla service refusal dialogue ("I am sorry, %PCName. There's nothing I can do for you now."). New dialogue was required given this stage of the "The Missing Missionary" quest.

BUG	The "House Redoran has... might do better." latest rumor response should not be said by Redoran members.
FIX	Filtered the dialogue (Not Faction Redoran = 1).

BUG	After completing the Gateway Ghost quest, Angaredhel responds to topic "gateway haunting" with "Angaredhel mentioned your handling of the Gateway haunting affair..."
FIX	Filtered dialogue correctly "Not ID angaredhel = 1"

BUG	Falasmaryon stronghold does spell out Falagmaryon in Daedric on the propylon portal.
FIX	Added a fixed texture (tx_portal_falagmaryon.dds).

BUG	Seyda Neen little advice topic about disposition ("It pays to...for a favor.").
FIX	|They let you know if you don't like them|==>|They let you know if they don't like you|

BUG	After you get Fast Eddie to mouth for you, and tell Aryon about it, the journal says Aryon promoted you to Master. Although Aryon gives you the choose to become Master, this does not happen immediately.
FIX |Master Aryon promoted me to Master in House Telvanni.| ==> |Master Aryon promised me the rank of Master in House Telvanni.|

BUG	Several trader banners in Sadrith Mora have "Dunmer" in their name, even though the traders themselves are not Dumner. These names look like placeholders.
FIX	|Dunmer Trader| ==> |Ancola: Trader|
	|Dunmer Trader| ==> |Elegal: Trader|
	|Dunmer Alchemy| ==> |Arangaer: Alchemist|
	|Dunmer Weapons/Armor| ==> |Anruin: Armorer|
	|Dunmer Weapons/Armor| ==> |Manicky: Armorer|

BUG	Typo in Big Helende's "Felen Maryon's staff" topic dialogue.
FIX	|If you there's| ==> |If there's|

BUG	Suran Services topic talks about "our local tradesmen and trainers". However, non of the traders mentioned offer trainings services.
FIX	Removed the "and trainers" part.

BUG	Vivec, Foreign Quarter latest rumors treats Lesley as female.
FIX	|she's moved her| ==> |he's moved his|

BUG	NoLore NPC in Ald'Ruhn shouldn't talk about the Aengoth the Jeweler topic.
FIX	Added "Not Local NoLore = 0" checks to two responses.*

BUG	NoLore NPC start talking about the Almalexia topic when Tribunal is installed.
FIX	Added "Not Local NoLore = 0" checks to six overlooked responses.

BUG	Caius Cosades' "Blades Trainers" topic says Sjorvar Horse-Mouth can be found "west of Ald'ruhn" (in the "Sjorvar Horse-Mouth" topic Caius replies correctly that he can be found "west of Caldera").
FIX	|west of Ald'ruhn| ==> |west of Caldera|

BUG	Priest, Priest Service, Monk & Healer topic Almalexia ("Blessed Almalexia the Warden is one of the three Immortals God-Kings of Morrowind...").
FIX	|Immortals| ==> |Immortal|

Journal:MS_BarbarianBook_B (100): |'financially embarrassed| ==> |'financially embarrassed'|
Topic=Bitter Coast:Class=Scout:Cell=Gnaar Mok:Not Local NoLore=0 and Random100<66: |Bitter Coast| ==> |the Bitter Coast|

Script Fixes

BUG	During the Fake Soul Gem (MG_Sabotage) quest for Ajira, if you engage Galbedir in conversation or go through a door while she is walking back to her desk, she stays put forever. This can be a problem in that if she stops in the middle of the hallway and you can't get around her.
FIX	Edited the script (galbedirScript) so that Galbedir will no longer stop to greet the player during the quest, and starts walking back again to her desk after changing cells. Also made sure she no longer walks into Marayn Dren by changing some coordinates.

BUG	The script on Bolvyn Venim makes you advance to the rank of Archmaster when defeating him in the duel. Yet, the journal states you should speak with Athyn Sarethi before you can be named the Archmaster of House Redoran.
FIX	Corrected the script (bolvynScript) so it doesn't advance you to Archmaster.

BUG	shrineTemple script won't charge non-members for Vivec's Mystery and Almsivi Restoration (script checks 25, when target should be 35).
FIX	Corrected.

BUG	There is a glitch associated with Golena's body causing it to spawn an infinite amount Poison Grip Arrows.
FIX	Corrected SadriFight script by adding a journal check.

Script=DaedraBoethiah: |Player->AddTopic "sculptor"| ==> |AddTopic "sculptor"|
Script=avSlavehunter: |Set counter to -1| ==> |Set timer to -1|
Script=Pub_RavenRock: relocks door at original lock level of 30 instead of 20
Script=shrineMaarGan: added "GetJournalIndex TT_MaarGan < 60" condition and removed unnecessary "Journal TT_MaarGan 20".
Script=UleniDead: |disable "Gateway_haunt"| ==> |"Gateway_haunt"->Disable|

General Fixes

BUG	Bloodmoon accidentally removed most contents from Com_Chest_11_k01. There are 55 instances of this chest in the vanilla game, and the single instance in Bloodmoon broke ALL of them.
FIX	Corrected.

BUG	Container tramaroot_06 is missing an Organic flag (Graphic Herbalism didn't recognize it) and levelled list.
FIX	Corrected.

BUG	Container Bloatspore and Kwama Egg Sack are missing the Respawn flags.
FIX	Corrected.

BUG	Raw Ebony containers rock_ebony_01_colony, rock_ebony_02_colony, rock_ebony_05_colony, rock_ebony_06_colony and rock_ebony_07_colony missing an Organic flag.
FIX	Corrected.

BUG	All but one Raw Adamantium container (rock_adam_pyXXm rock_adam_moldXX) missing an Organic flag.
FIX	Corrected.

BUG	The book "Provinces of Tamriel" was supposed to show an image of the provinces but doesn't because of a wrong filename.
FIX	|theempire.tga| ==> |theempire_377_253.tga|

BUG	Scroll of Elemental Burst:Frost font size is way to big.
FIX	|SIZE="12"| ==> |SIZE="2"|

BUG	Scroll of Elemental Burst: Fire has writ information written in it.
FIX	<DIV ALIGN="center"><FONT COLOR="000000" SIZE="2" FACE="Daedric">IGNITE THE OPPOSITION</FONT><BR>

BUG	Elone says Arrille has a copy of Guide to Vvardenfell ("...get a copy of 'Guide to Vvardenfell' from Arrille...") but he doesn't.
FIX	Arrille now sells a copy of Guide to Vvardenfell.

BUG	The PC couldn't rest in Abandoned Shipwreck, Upper Level.
FIX	Removed "Illegal To Sleep Here" flag.

BUG	common_shirt_02_h is brown but has a blue icon.
FIX	Made a new icon (Adjusting the textures of the shirt itself instead, would conflict with both clothing and icon replacers).

BUG	The room in Andus Tradehouse in Maar Gan is only locked AFTER the PC rented it once.
FIX	Added a 20 lock to the door (just like its rent script does).

BUG	Three Holly Berry bushes in the Skaal village are not harvestable because they were set as static and not container.
FIX	Replaced them with identical Flora_BM_holly_06 in the exact same positions.

BUG	Mornsu Omalor carries 12 random bows and one random arrow.
FIX	Gave her one random bow and 12 random arrows.

BUG	There are two versions of Dumbuk gro-Bolak. He can be found at both the Imperial Legion strongholds of Gnisis and Wolverine Hall. The "little advice" topic ("My notion of...and Vvardenfell.") tells the PC he can be found near the barracks in Gnisis.
FIX	Removed the clone near Wolverine Hall.

BUG	Player can get stuck in Urn when leaving Balmora, Itan's House.
FIX	Moved the doormarker a bit.

BUG	Suran Temple exterior door is Hlaalu instead of Velothi (like the rest of Suran). Aside from obvious reasons, the Hlaalu door doesn't fit into the Temple mesh.
FIX	Replaced the door with a Velothi one. Also fixed the floating temple.

BUG	NPC Brallion is supposed to stand on the platform next to the slaves in Sadrith Mora. But he has a Follow AI package on Telvanni guard causing him following them wherever he goes.
FIX	Removed the Follow AI package.

BUG	Ajira mentions she has Telvanni Bug musk, Mazte, Flin and Sujamma for sale, but doesn't offer any of them.
FIX	Added one of each to her inventory.

BUG	There's a door to "Queen's Lair" in Sarimisun-Assa Egg Mine. When you go through it, you'll spawn on the other side in the air, about a meter above ground.
FIX	Moved the Door Marker a bit.

BUG	A chest in Dralas Ancestral Tomb does nothing when activated and doesn't shown on tooltip, because it's locked with "lock 0".
FIX	Replaced by lock 10 (like similar tomb chests).

BUG	Undead creature (in_tomb_all_lev+0) in Andas Ancestral Tomb 802, 794, -942 will be stuck inside the pillar and unable to move or attack because the spawn is to close to a pillar.
FIX	Moved the spawn point.

BUG	For some mysterious reason, all items and containers (even statics like walls, stairs, lava and sound generators) in Dagoth Ur, Inner Facility, Lower Facility & Outer Facility are owned, which means taking anything there will mark it as stolen. Dagoth Ur, Lower Facility & Outer Facility items are owned by Bodean, a hostile NPC outside a Daedric ruin. Dagoth Ur, Inner Facility items are owned by Asha-Ammu Kutebani, an NPC in Gnisis.
FIX	Removed the unnecessary ownership (apart from the statics).


~~~
Creature Fixes

BUG	Plague Bear and Plague Wolf diseases don't work because they were added as spell instead as per script. Also, their Resist Paralysis was given as spell by mistake, instead of an ability (they don't have enough magicka to cast these spells anyway).
FIX	Gave them a Resist Paralysis 50 pts ability and correct disease scripts.

BUG	Some blighted Kwama variants are named incorrectly.
FIX	|Kwama Forager| ==> |Blighted Kwama Forager|
	|Kwama Warrior| ==> |Blighted Kwama Warrior|
	|Kwama Worker| ==> |Blighted Kwama Worker|

BUG	"h2o_all_lev-2" spawn in Ascadian Isle Region (4,-15) 37227, -114760, 376 spawns slaughterfish and dreugh on land.
FIX	Replaced the spawn with an "ex_shore_mudcrab" on the exact same position.

BUG	There's a Sixth House levelled list spawn underwater in Bitter Coast Region (-5,-8) 39046, -65406, -219.
FIX	Replaced with the usual h2o_all_lev+2 levelled list.

BUG	Water creatures spawn (ex_shore_all_lev+0) on land in Red Mountain Region (1,10) 14423, 89003, 11863.
FIX	Replaced with the usual ex_RedMtn_all_lev+0 levelled list.

BUG	Some creatures missed their correct soundgen.
FIX	dagoth endus, soundgen ash_ghoul
	BM_bear_black_summon, soundgen BM_bear_black
	BM_wolf_grey_summon, soundgen BM_wolf_grey

BUG	Yagrum Bagarn never plays his Hello and Idle voiceovers ("A visitor! What...Last Living Dwarf?", "Now... if I...MORE complex surfaces...") or his idle animation.
FIX	Gave him a Wander AI package and an AI Hello rating of 30.*
	*Requires MCP "Creature voiceover enable"

BUG	Ascended Sleeper doesn't play its attack and idle sounds.
FIX	Corrected.

BUG	Draugr were not set as Undead creature type.
FIX	Marked BM_draugr01, BM_draugr_bloodskal, draugr, draugr_aesliip, draugr_co_3, draugr_co_3_dead and draugr_valbrandr as Undead.


~~~
Magic and Enchantment Fixes

BUG	"absorb willpower [ranged]", "absorb intelligence [ranged]" and "absorb luck [ranged]" spells use Agility instead of associated attributes.
FIX	Corrected.

BUG	Shockball spell has the exact same stats as Greater Shockball (and Greater Fireball and Greater Frostball for that matter). Stats should be like its Fireball and Frostball counterparts.
FIX	Corrected.

BUG	Enchantments "cruel spark_en" and "dire spark_en" are identical. The latter should have a range of 5-11 like the other "dire" enchantments. The same applies to "cruel shardbolt_en" and "dire shard_en".
FIX	Gave "dire spark_en" and "dire shard_en" a range of 5-11.

BUG	Demoralize Humanoid is under the magic school of Mysticism, while its casting effects, its icon, and its counterpart (Demoralize Creature) are all under the school of Illusion.
FIX	Changed school to Illusion.

BUG	Brittlewind is a rather dangerous spell from Bloodmoon, only used by the Ice Witches, Wind Witches and Fryse Hags. Some mods (e.g. Wakim's Game Improvements, Galsiah's Character Development) unintentionally add this spell to the pool of spells available to everybody; causing some NPCs wreaking havoc.
FIX	Changed the Brittlewind spell from an autocalced spell to a non-autocalced spell.

BUG	Both Bound Battle Axe and Bound Cuirass use Restoration sound effects.
FIX	Assigned Conjuration sound effects.

BUG	Summon Bonewolf is labelled as Alteration spell and uses a deviant particle texture.
FIX	Made it Conjuration and assigned the regular Summon particle texture.


~~~
Armor and Weapon Fixes

BUG	Tribunal introduces a female appearance for Steel Cuirass, but Bloodmoon overwrites it back to match vanilla Morrowind.
FIX	Corrected.

BUG	Most Iron weapons have incorrect enchantments ("On Target" instead of "Cast of Stike"). Virtually every other weapon in the game uses "Cast of Stike". The only exception is War Axe of Wounds; which also doesn't match his counterpart the Battleaxe of Wounds (which is "Cast of Stike").
FIX	Assigned the correct enchantments to all of them: |..._enu| ==> |..._en| & |wound_enu| ==> |wound_en|

BUG	Shockbite Battle Axe, Shockbite Halberd, Shockbite Mace, Shockbite Warhammer and Iron Sparkslayer have incorrect enchantments for no apparent reason ("sparkbolt_en" instead of "spark_en"). 
FIX	Assigned the correct enchantments to them |sparkbolt_en| ==> |spark_en|

BUG	Stormkiss has an incorrect enchantment and is missing "Ignore Normal Weapon Resistance" like its counterparts have.
FIX	Corrected |lightning bolt_en| ==> |lightning strike_en|

BUG	Shockbite Warhammer, BanHammer, Iron Spider Dagger and Imperial Netch Blade are missing "Ignore Normal Weapon Resistance", based on their counterparts.
FIX	Corrected.

BUG	Velothi's Shield has Chitin Shield (light armor) stats but uses Imperial Shield (heavy armor) as base item.
FIX	Changed the model and icon to Chitin Shield. Lorewise does also makes more sense since Veloth was a Chimer afterall.

BUG	Feather Shield has Chitin Tower Shield (light armor) stats but uses Imperial Shield (heavy armor) as base item.
FIX	Changed the model and icon to Chitin Tower Shield.

BUG	Shield of Light has Netch Leather Shield (light armor) stats but uses Imperial Shield (heavy armor) as base item.
FIX	Changed the model and icon to Netch Leather Shield.

BUG	The Bonebiter Bow is a Chitin Short Bow in the vanilla game, though dialogue states it is a Bonemold Long Bow ("...this bonemold long bow deep in the burial caverns...", "...his spirit guards his bonemold long bow...").
FIX	Changed the model and icon to Bonemold Long Bow.

BUG Steel throwing knife uses the wrong model and icon.
FIX	Changed to the dedicated vanilla model and icon.

BUG	Iron Tanto uses the Steel Tanto model by default.
FIX	Corrected.

BUG Weapons "iron flameslayer", "iron shardslayer", "iron sparkslayer" and "iron viperslayer" have the wrong icons that don't match their models.
FIX	Changed to w\Tx_Claymore_Iron.tga


~~~
Quest Fixes

BUG	"Death of a Taxman" quest had several problems.
FIX	Journal index 40 and 80 should be labeled as quest finishes and consequently stop every possible progression of the quest. Previously, the quest would remain in the journal indefinitely.
To ensure a normal quest progression, Foryn Gilnith won't talk about anything until journal index 48. Previously, choices didn't have any consequences and the finished states of the quest didn't make any sense, because the PC could simply pick up on the quest again by talking to Gilnith again.
A new journal entry was made to do justice to the scenario in which Foryn gives the PC the ring to return it to Thavere. Previously, the journal stated that the PC took it from his body.

BUG	"HR_ArobarKidnap" quest. Both 20 and 45 journal entries are never updated in the vanilla game.
FIX	Corrected. Arhyn Sarethis will now also have a response to recognize journal index 34 (previously introduced by UMP).

BUG	"Mephala's Quest" quest. Quest stage 20 is never set in the journal. Without it, the PC doesn't know where to find the target. There's a topic "sensitive matters" but it's not available from the journal index.
FIX	The text of index 40 ("I have agreed...poison Balyn Omavel.") has been replaced with that of 20 ("Apparently, one of...lives in Balmora."). This seems to be the most sensible fix, since all information from journal index 40 is covered by index 20. Merging these indexes or changing dialogue would be too messy.

BUG	"Thelas' Pillows" quest. You'll only be able to get the "pillow shipment" topic from Drarayne if you have her Invoice with you and have told Drarayne what you did for the "Exterminator" quest but turned in the quest in by Eydis yet. This is a highly unlikely scenario.
FIX	Removed the mysterious filter from Thelas' dialogue.

BUG	“Thieves Guild: Nerano Manor Key” quest. Sovor Trandel's response to the Nerano Manor topic ("That's where I...a bit more.") should only be said when the Nerano Manor Key quest is started already. Otherwise the quest cannot be completed and remains in the journal indefinitely when you're not a Thieves Guild member. Also, Sovor Trandel's response to the Ondres Nerano topic ("Just don't tell...got the key.") shouldn't be said when he didn't give you the key. Trandel's key was also not removed from his inventory when giving it to you.
FIX	Added "Journal TG_ManorKey = 10" filter to his Nerano Manor dialogue. Added "Journal TG_ManorKey < 100" filter to his  Ondres Nerano dialogue. The key will now correctly be removed from his inventory.

BUG	The Vampire "Blood Ties" quest doesn't have a journal quest entry. The name exists but "Quest name" was not checked in the CS.
FIX	Checked "Quest name".

BUG	"Alms from the Skyrim Mission" quest. Ingokning actually only gives 5 gold if her Disposition is low but it's written 10 gold in the journal.
FIX	Made her give 10 gold (like she does in similar quests).

BUG	"Rescue Jocien Ancois" quest. During this quest, if the PC speak to Assaba-Bentus after freeing Jocien, he still thinks he's with the outcast.
FIX	Added IL_RescueHermit < 50 check to the "Jocien Ancois" topic ("He came to...shirt without help.")

BUG	Rovone Arvel still sends the PC to Odral Helvi after the "Rent and Taxes" quests.
FIX	Added Journal HH_RentCollector < 100 check to "Go to Odral Helvi..." dialogue.
	Added check Journal HH_RentCollector < 65 to "Odral is demanding..." dialogue.

BUG	In the "Disease Carrier" quest for the Tribunal Temple, the PC is able to convince Tanusea Veloth to leave without quoting Saryoni's Sermons, but the journal will still say: "I convinced Tanusea Veloth with quotes from the sacred texts of the Temple. She agreed to go to the Corprusarium."
FIX	An additional journal entry has been added which says "I convinced Tanusea Veloth to leave the city of Vivec and go to the Corprusarium."

BUG	"Auriel's Bow" quest. The journal entry 100 incorrectly states that she gives you 5000 gold to go away. Also, the quest can be done without belonging to House Telvanni if you activate the topic "Auriel's Bow", which the Museum of Artifacts in Mournhold (Tribunal expansion) introduced.
FIX	Filtered two diaogue entries for the "Auriel's Bow" topic to Telvanni only
	HT_AurielBow 100 |5000| ==> |11,111|

BUG	"Larrius Varro Tells a Little Story" quest. The journal would still update Larrius Varro quest trough the "little secret" topic in Balmora ("Somebody said ...know what about."), even when you killed him (say, for the Morag Tong) which would leave the aforementioned quest trapped in the journal.
FIX	Added "Dead larrius varro = 0" to the dialogue.

BUG	“Temple: Malacath of the House of Troubles” quest. Due to a bug, it is possible to receive this quest by speaking to Saryoni about “bad daedra” and then “four corners” ("The First Corner... House of Troubles.") at any time, even if you aren't a member of the Tribunal Temple.
FIX	Added "PC Faction Temple" filter to the dialogue.

BUG	"Compassion" quest. Tuls Valen doesn't mark Ald Velothi on the PCs map when pointing the way to Maelkashishi.
FIX	Corrected.

BUG	Almalexia "task" topic can break quests by getting her responses too early.
FIX	Added "TR_Bamz >=100" to prevent this.

BUG	The player doesn't actually need to be carrying 100 gold to pay Fjol the Outlaw in Larrius Varro's "MV_Bastard" quest.
FIX	Added a "Item Gold_001 >= 100" check to Fjol the Outlaw's dialogue.

BUG	Journal entry IL_ScrapMetal refers to the Imperial Legion having a context with the Buoyant Armigers, but Radd Hard-Heart's "scrap metal" dialogue says it's the Ordinators.
FIX	Changed Radd Hard-Heart's dialogue to Buoyant Armigers. This seems to make most sense lore-wise since "[Buoyant Armigers] pattern themselves on Vivec's heroic spirit of exploration and adventure" while the Ordinators are "employed by the Temple to guard their sacred sites".

BUG	"The Angry Trader" quest. Quest stage 30 is never set ("I've found where Alvur Hleran and Dondir were hiding, and was able to recover the glass."). Additionally, Tinos' Greeting #5 ("Listen up, if...stole all my goods.") should not display the quest starter line after starting the quest.
FIX	A new script will trigger journal index 30 when all ten pieces of Raw Glass are in your inventory. Added "Journal MV_AngryTrader < 10" filter to the dialogue.

BUG	"Yagrum Bagarn and Wraithguard" quest. The quest can't be continued if the player has health between 200 and 220 because of a wrong dialogue filter (Info ID:311232269721474412041).
FIX	Filter health by 200 instead of 220.

BUG	HT_DaedraSkin 10 journal entry.
FIX	|Mouth Mallam Ryon| ==> |Mouth Galos Mathendis|

BUG	"A Contact in the Dark Brotherhood" quest may be mis-reported in the journal as being a Mages Guild quest. Must be Morag Tong. 
FIX	|Mages Guild| ==> |Morag Tong|

BUG	"Writ for Mathyn Bemis"	quest. The quest Writ for Mathyn Bemis is related to the Mages Guild in the journal entry instead of the Morag Tong
FIX	|Mages Guild| ==> |Morag Tong|

BUG	"The Bad Actor" quest. The refusal journal entry refers to Marcel Maurard as an actor, though the PC has not discovered this information yet.
FIX	|actor| ==> |vendor|

BUG	Ranis states in her initial dialogue for the "Manwe's Dues" quest that that Manwe has failed to pay her dues for several years, and she now owes us over 2000 septims. Journal Entry Index 10 for the quest states that Manwe hasn't paid her dues in three months.
FIX	|three months| ==> |three years|

BUG	"Beluelle's silver bowl" quest. Ygfa points the PC to "an east-west rope bridge across a lagoon [...] north from the bridge to the Foreign Quarter of Vivec". This is just a normal wooden bridge however.
FIX	|rope| ==> |wooden|

BUG	When the PC acquires the Odd Dwemer Weapon from Karrod, the journal reports that it's a deadly shortblade, while it's actually classified as long blade.
FIX	|deadly shortblade| ==> |deadly long blade|

BUG	Aengoth refers to the Darts of Judgment as being arrows ("Eindel has four...don't want them."). The arrow version of the Dart of Judgment can still be seen in the Construction Set but don't appear in the game.
FIX	|arrows| ==> |missiles|

BUG	Adusamsi Assurnarairan wrongly states that Llaren Terano carries the Rotheran Slave Key (Greeting 5: "Please. Llaren Terano… my ring. Please.") & Journal IC27_Oracle_A (Adusamsi Assurnarairan asked… their slave key.)) Irvsie Othran is the one who carries the Rotheran Slave Key.
FIX	|Llaren Terano| ==> |Irvsie Othran|

Script Fixes

BUG	Each time the PC prays at a special Shrines (Pilgrimages of the Seven Graces) the PC gets the message "Your journal has been updated" even if they have already prayed at this particular shrine and after completing the Pilgrimages of the Seven Graces quest.
FIX	Corrected.

BUG	The massage "The crank seems to be stuck." was never shown because of an error in the "nchulfetingthRight" script.
FIX	Corrected.

BUG	Slaves Yakov and Khinjarsi can never be freed because of missing slaveScript.
FIX	Corrected.

BUG	Script "viatrix_petilia" doesn't update the journal as it should on Viatrix Petilia's death.
FIX	Corrected.

BUG	Script "menhirTelNaga"
FIX	|GetPCRank "House Telvanni"| ==> |GetPCRank "Telvanni"|

BUG	Script "menhirTelUvirith"
FIX	|GetPCRank "House Telvanni"| ==> |GetPCRank "Telvanni"|

BUG	cattleScript should have "short NoLore"
FIX	Corrected.

BUG	cattle_kha_f01 uses the wrong script.
FIX	|slavescript| ==> |cattlescript|

BUG	The Ghostgate Shrine ("shrineGhostgate" script) takes one of every soul gem; while it indicates to take only one ("Would you like to donate a soul gem and ask for a blessing?").
FIX	Made the shrine only take one of your cheapest quality soul gems. Made the journal index update only once. Made the script stop processing when in menu mode. The shrine will now also indicate what quality soul gem it will take.

Dialogue / Text Fixes (grammar, inconsistencies, etc)

BUG Shargam gro-Shagdulg  in Balmora has a unique rumor about the murder of Ralen Hlaalo. But when you ask him about Ralen Hlaalo topic, he acts as if he doesn't know him ("Who?").
FIX Added "NotID shargam gro-shagdulg = 1" check to the later.

BUG	"Greeting 1" "Hello, %PCName. I see you've accomodated Olvyne's wishes. Nicely done. Now, if you could assist us one last time, we'd be most thankful."
FIX	|accomodated| ==> |accommodated|

BUG	"Greeting 1" "The Rite of the Wolf Giver requires one bunch of ripened belladonna berries. Unripened berries won't do, I'm afraid. You can find ripened belladonna berries on belladonna plants that grow near Solstheim's burial barrows, for they thrive on death. The Spriggan creatures have also been known to possess them, on occassion. When you have one bunch of ripened belladonna berries, return it to me."
FIX	|occassion| ==> |occasion|

BUG	"Greeting 5" "Are you here to serve the Temple by performing duties, %PCRank? Or have you come for something else" was never shown because it was always overruled by Greetings 5: "What brings you to the Temple, %PCRank? Have you been lax in your duties?" with the same conditions.
FIX	Filtered the dialogue for Uvoo Llaren. Not only is this specific entry directly under her dialogue tree, but she is also the most picky about PC rank of all Temple Masters, which reflects in this greeting.

BUG	Greeting:Greeting9:Cell=Pelagiadn:Disp=40:Random100 < 50: Only 1 of the 5 entries currently fires.
FIX	|Random100 < 50 | ==> |Random100 < 10| and the next 3 below in order: |Random100 < 50 | ==> |Random100 < 20|, |Random100 < 50| ==> |Random100 < 30|, |Random100 < 50| ==> |Random100 < 40|.

BUG	Voice:Hello:ID=2353436633063728922:Race=Nord:Sex=Female:Disp=50:Global PCRace >= 20
FIX	|Global PCRace >= 20| ==> |Global Random100 >= 20|

BUG	Voice:Hello:Race=Redguard:Sex=Males:Disp=70:Global PCRace >= 0
FIX	|Global PCRace >= 0| ==> |Global PCRace >= 1|

BUG	"someone in particular" topic for St. Olms ("All sorts of...the Foreign Quarter.") mentions Crassius Curio living there. This is not true.
FIX	|Three Hlaalu lords also live here -- Crassius Curio, Yngling Half-Troll, and Dram Bero.| ==> |Two Hlaalu lords also live here -- Yngling Half-Troll and Dram Bero.|

BUG	Savile Imayn shouldn't talk about herself in the "recruit some miners" topic ("I do not...one for sale.")
FIX	Filtered dialogue correctly "Not ID savile imayn = 1".

BUG	Dialogue in 'Orvas Dren' topic should not be said by Orvas Dren.
FIX	Added "Not ID Orvas Dren Druglord = 1" to "He's the brother...our rightful homeland".

BUG	Imperial Legionaries in Gnisis talk about the eggmine as though they are not Imperial Legion.
FIX	Added a "Not Faction Imperial Legion = 1" filter to this "little advice" dialogue ("They've sealed...the river bed.")

BUG	Captain Flax Carius shouldn't talk about himself in the "dry fort topic" ("Got nothing else...talk to the Captain").
FIX	Filtered dialogue correctly "Not ID flax carius = 1"

BUG	Savile Imayn shouldn't talk about herself in the "recruit some miners" ("I do not...one for sale.")
FIX	Filtered dialogue correctly "Not ID savile imayn = 1"

BUG	Dialogue in 'Dranas Sarathram' topic should not be said by Dranas Sarathram.
FIX	Added "Not ID dranas sarathram = 1" to "He's the slave trader in town."

BUG	Despite his loyalty to Helseth, if the PC asks Karrod about Helseth, he'll give an oddly unpatriotic response ("He's our new King, I suppose...") and wonder whether Helseth had anything to do with King Llethan's and Talen Vandas' deaths. If the PC asks him about Talen Vandas, he will remark "Now there's a man who could lead our people!". He even thinks that the Royal Guards (presumably including himself) are thugs. These are generic dialogue statements that the PC can get from almost anyone in Mournhold. 
FIX	Made an exception for Karrod in these dialogues.

BUG	Non-Khajiit NPC use a greeting where they refer to themselves in third person ("%PCName! Please...help a friend.").
FIX	Filtered the greeting for Khajiit only.

BUG	NPC that aren't supposed to have dialogue topics "Telvanni BUG musk", "Solstheim" and "latest rumors" in their dialogue box.
FIX	Removed the topics from NoLore NPCs by adding an extra condition to the dialogue.

BUG	If the disposition of any of the traders associated with the great houses is more than 70, they will be using a Greeting that is supposed to only appear when "hortator quest >= 50" for that respective house ("Hello, %PCName. I...a little secret?").
FIX	Added "sarethihortator >= 50" conditionals for these Greetings.

BUG	Vedam Dren's "Dunmer" topic ("It will be...must unite us.") speaks of Dagoth Ur and Red Mountain after main quest.
FIX	Filtered dialogue correctly "Journal C3_DestroyDagoth < 50"

BUG	Drelasa Ramothran's greeting for Thieves Guild members displays "%PCRank" because she is not a member herself ("Welcome, %PCRank %PCName...know what's hot.").
FIX	|Welcome, %PCRank %PCName| ==> |Welcome, %PCName|

BUG	Yagrum Bagarn's dialogue for "Dwemer boots" topic ("Lord Fyr obtained...sincere apologies.") is missing two commas and the word "to".
FIX	Corrected.

BUG	sc_radrenesspellbreaker is called "Scroll of Radrene'sSpellBreaker" because there is too little space.
FIX	|Scroll of Radrene'sSpellBreaker| ==> |Radrene's Spell Breaker Scroll|

BUG	In Telvanni territories there are non-Dunmer stating they are annoyed with abolitionists and they state that outlanders shouldn't meddle with their rights to own slaves ("These outlanders won't...their damn business."). Naturally this makes no sense when the speaker is an outlander themselves and therefore can't have the right to own slaves covered under the Armistice, which covers native born Dunmer exclusive.
FIX	Filtered the dialogue for Telvanni territory Dunmer only.

BUG	Some NPC are not supposed to have normal speech patterns. Louis Beauchamp and Yakum Hairshashishi can speak perfect normally when asked about generic topics, whereas they're supposed to have a unique way of speaking.
FIX	Added a "nolore" script to Louis Beauchamp and Yakum Hairshashishi (as Bethesda did for Ra'Gruzgob and Thrud).

BUG	Twin Lamps factions only rank is called "Twin Lamps".
FIX	|Twin Lamps| ==> |Abolitionist|

BUG	Typo in Journal Entry Index 10 of the Sujamma to Dunirai quest (FG_DuniraiSupply).
FIX	|the Dunirai Caverns which| ==> |the Dunirai Caverns, which|

BUG	Typo in Imsin the Dreamer's dialogue the Maiden's Token quest for the Imperial Legion (IL_MaidenToken).
FIX	|Hurry before| ==> |Hurry, before|

BUG	Blades trainers speak about their affiliation even before the PC delivers the package to Caius ("background" and "rules" topic).
FIX	Blades trainers will no longer reveal their secret identity; not until the PC joined their faction.

BUG	NPC say that Daedric Shrines are grey-green in colour, but they only appear as a vivid pinkish red.
FIX	|grey-green| ==> |grey-red|

BUG	In Ald'ruhn NPC will mention that Dandera Selaro works IN Ald'ruhn-under-skar in the "little advice" topic ("If you want...be worth a look.").
FIX	|in| ==> |in front of|

BUG	NPC will say that Meralyn Othan is "toward the west side of the Bazaar", but she is actually at the top of the stairs on the east side.
FIX	|west| ==> |east|

BUG	Aryon's supposed to have extra dialogue for the PC inviting them to join House Telvanni ("I am Master Aryon...the Mages Guild."), but it has a greyed-out "female" filter, so it never actually appears.
FIX	Corrected.

BUG	Nine-Toes "latest rumors" topic.
FIX	|goods maps| ==> |good maps|

BUG	Falanu Indaren says "...the were too much..."
FIX	|the| ==> |they|

BUG	"Golena Sadri" "Oh, dear. Poor Tadera... Poor Golena! If only there were something more we could've done for her. But I understand, %PCName. You had no choice but to defend yourself. You did the right thing. She was too detatched from reality to recognize you. Or probably anyone, for that matter. Don't feel guilty."
FIX	|detatched| ==> |detached|

BUG	"stock certificate" "Yes, well, you'll have to actually have the certificate in your posession for me to exchange it."
FIX	|posession| ==> |possession|

BUG	"BM_Morale" "The soldiers seem willing to take the alcohol in my posession in exchange for information about what has become a dry fort. It seems that a bit of the drink makes them much more disposed to chatting."
FIX	|posession| ==> |possession|

BUG	"the Udyrfrykte" "I bow before you, my chieftain! You have slain the Udyrfrykte and claimed Thirsk as your own. Only the greatest warrior could kill such a ancient beast!"
FIX	|a ancient| ==> |an ancient|

BUG	There is a typo in the quest name "The Shirt of His Back".
FIX	|of| ==> |off| (This makes sense since Rasha takes off his shirt during this quest)

BUG	"Telvanni agents" "You got all four? Good. That'll make some people at Caldera Mining Company very happy. And here's 400 septims. The Caldera Mining Company pays well. And when your ready for more orders, let me know."
FIX	|your| ==> |you're| 

BUG	Caius Cosades dialogue for "House Redoran" and "House Telvanni" topics ("Talk to...retrainer")
FIX	|be become| ==> |become|

BUG	"Greetings 9" 34072753983316925 ("It's good of...to ask about?")

								 Patch for Purists v3.0.0 patch notes [December 12th, 2018]
========================================================================================================================

~~~
General Fixes

BUG	Axes use bow grab/drop sounds.
FIX	Implemented axe weapon sounds IDs.*
	*Requires MCP "Separate axe inventory sounds"

BUG	Blunt weapons use the grab/drop sounds.
FIX	Implemented blunt weapon sounds IDs.*
	*Requires MCP "Separate axe inventory sounds"

BUG	House Hlaalu can be joined even if you are a member of another house. The reason this works is because Vedam Drens dialogue doesn't check to see if you're a house member, only if you're Hortator.
FIX	Added an additional filter to Vedam Drens "Camonna Tong" dialogue (PC Faction Hlaalu).

BUG	If you enter the Drethan Ancestral Tomb once and then leave, upon your return Marara won't use any of the vampire spells or have glowing eyes.
FIX	Edited the script so that this no longer happened.

BUG	Killing cattle of other vampire clans will also present you with the journal entry that you killed your own cattle and are no longer welcome.
FIX	Punishment will only happen if the killing happended in your own clan.

BUG	Several banners in Vivec, Foreign Quarter Canalworks have ownership, resulting in a crime when activated.
FIX	Removed the ownership of the following banners: Agrippina Herennia: Clothier, Jeanne: Trader, Simine Fralinie: Bookseller.

BUG	Due to poor conditions, Dagoth Ur's grunt sounds where not triggered by the game.
FIX	Added conditions for them.

BUG	Breton male faces batting their eyes when they speak because of wrong a wrong value in one of the Forward/backward fields for quadratic interpolation.
FIX	Value was changed in NifSkope.


~~~
Creature Fixes

BM_riekling_Dulk_UNIQUE, soundgen bm_riekling
BM_riekling_Krish_UNIQU, soundgen bm_riekling

BUG	According to Dagoth Ur's and the named Ash Vampires' dialogue, it is a House Dagoth custom to let their challenger deliver the first blow ("You are the challenger ... to you goes the courtesy of the first blow." / "You are the challenger. To you goes the first blow." / "You are the challenger ... yours is the first move." / "You're the challenger ... you deliver the first blow."). Despite this, the named Ash Vampires attack you on sight.
FIX	Prevented the named Ash Vampires from being immediately hostile. You can now attack first or talk to them. Whether they stay calm depends on the Ash Vampire in question. Dagoth Gilvoth will always be hostile given his dialogue. For others it depends on how you end the conversation (inspired by what Bethesda did with Dagoth Uthol).

BUG	Killing Ash Vampires does not weaken Dagoth Ur like it is supposed to (Strength -5 pts, Willpower -5 pts, Speed -5 pts, Health -50 pts, Fatigue -50 pts, Magicka -250 pts). The existing script would only work when you visit the first form of Dagoth Ur before killing the Ash Vampires. Scripts cannot modify stats on NPCs or creatures that have not been loaded in-game.
FIX	Now killing Ash Vampires weakens Dagoth Ur as Bethesda originally intended. The second incarnation is not affected.

BUG	Winged Twilights do not drop Daedra Hearts in-game dialogue mentions ("The winged twilight are the female-formed Daedric messengers of the Daedra Lord Azura. Daedra hearts have modest magical properties.").
FIX	Winged Twilights now drop Daedra Hearts.


~~~
Quest Fixes

BUG	It is possible to acquire the House Redoran quest “Mudcrab Pests” while not a member of House Redoran, which makes it impossible to finish the quest by reporting back, leaving the quest stuck in the player’s journal. Also, it does not make sense to "report back to Neminda" (HR_MudcrabNest 40) when you have never met her. She can’t even finish the quest when you are not a House Redoran member.
FIX	Duplicated the dialogue tree Drulene Falen’s final responses and made it update to Journal HR_MudcrabNest 100 instead of 40 (the one refering to Neminda) for non-House Redoran players. The quest should now be completable for members and non-members House Redoran alike. The fact that Drulene has two separate greetings regarding the hostile mudcrabs (one for people who are sent by House Redoran's Neminda ("Did Neminda send...these hostile mudcrabs?") and a general one ("Some hostile Mudcrabs...one of my guar!")) makes it clear that this was Bethesda’s original intention. Removed the "House Redoran:" part from the questname.

BUG	If you bring up the topic of Ald Velothi with Neminda before starting the Deliver Cure Disease Potion quest, it will skip straight to stage 20, meaning that she will believe she has already given you the Cure Disease potion; skipping the first journal entry completely.
FIX	Added a check (Journal|HR_Courier|>=|10) to the topic.

BUG	If you completed the "An Attack on Mournhold" quest before the Crimson Plague quest, Mehra Helas won’t give you the latest rumor which starts the latter quest. 
FIX	Added a check (Journal|MS_CrimsonPlague|>=|10) to her latest rumor ("The situation in...was pretty terrible.").

BUG	If you turn in the EEC Stock Certificate at its maximum value of 12,000 gold the game tries to add an entry in a journal topic that doesn't exist (Journal CO_Stock 20). This may crash the game.
FIX	Corrected: |Journal CO_Stock 20| ==> |set ColonyStock to 2|

BUG	When you say you'll listen, Milyn Faram ("Odirniran" quest) may give incorrect dialogue, skipping the scroll reward and also the journal entry that would have made Aryon give the staff and book.
FIX	Reordered dialogue in the right way.

BUG	Milyn Faram ("Odirniran" quest) gives a -10 disposition decrease when you have not honored his wishes (not killing Vedelea Othril), yet also a disposition when you complete his task according to his wishes. The disposition decrease was clearly meant for when you killed Vedelea Othril.
FIX	Changed the -10 disposition decrease to a 10 disposition increase.

BUG	The option to buy the Staff of the Silver Dawn from Arielle Phiencel only appears if you have the 300 gold required. If you don't she will use the same dialogue as the rest of the Mages Guild members.
FIX	Removed an incorrectly inserted dialogue check (Item|Gold_001|>=|300).

BUG	In the House Redoran quest "Rescue Varvur Sarethi" the guards (Ald-ruhn, Venim Manor Right Wing) are supposed to become hostile if they see you escaping with Sarethi. However, on rare occasions they initially become hostile but then put their weapons away and ignore you. This is because the guards will stop attacking when the script makes Varvur stop combat.
FIX	Fixed the responsible script (venimGuardScript).

BUG	In the House Redoran quest "Rescue Varvur Sarethi" Varvur will attack the guards in the other rooms instead of running.
FIX	Added new code to do stop his combat if he attacks the other guards (varvurSarethiScript).

BUG	Drulene Falen might not offer to buy Corky ("Rent and Taxes" quest), instead just saying "He's doing fine, %PCName" when you choose the topic Corky in conversation with her.
FIX	Corky can now be sold to Druelen Falen.


~~~
Script Fixes

BUG	Due to scripting errors, Gedna Relvel will not have added bonuses for Magicka and Fatigue based on your level. Instead its Health will be fortified by a total of 800× your character's Level, rather than 100x, as was intended. This makes the lich almost unkillable at higher levels.
FIX	Corrected the script.

Dialogue / Text Fixes (grammar, inconsistencies, etc)

FIX	The "E-e--e-excuse me..." Nerevarine greeting is badly filtered.
BUG	The greetings should now be properly filter to the Pauper class for compatibility with Tamriel Rebuilt.

BUG	West and east are switched in the Balmora Services topic (Go to Hlaalu...of the river.).
FIX	Corrected.

BUG	Mournhold "latest rumors" topic about Plague (“There seems to...we've been seeing.”) should stop after quest is started. It should also update the journal because the designation is focused on the second quest stage.
FIX	Added a check (Journal|MS_CrimsonPlague| <| 20) and a result (Journal MS_CrimsonPlague 10).

BUG	Mehra Helas still says her greeting (“If you have…help the community.”) and latest rumor (“I've heard there's...offer your help.”) after the "Crimson Plague" quest is finished.
FIX	Added a check to both (Journal|MS_CrimsonPlague|<|10).

BUG	Bevene Releth, Bivale Teneran, Daynes Redothril, Llether Vari and Tiras Sadus keep greeting the player with the question if you would be interested in a little work, even after you've returned the items from Ienas Sarandas.
FIX	Filtered the greetings correclty (Journal|Town_Aldruhn|=|0).

BUG	The "Vodunius Nuccius" topic for Darvame Hleran (Oh. Yes. He ... here in Morrowind.) should no longer be available for her after he leaves.
FIX	Filtered the dialogue correctly (Journal|MS_Nuccius|<|100). Also changed "...here in Morrowind." to "...here on Vvardenfel." since Vodunius moves to Narsis, which is part of the Morrowind province.

BUG	One of the items you are requested to find during the "Redas Tomb" quest is the Redas Chalice. It is referred to as such in dialogue and the journal entries. However, it is actually listed as "Redas Goblet" for the actual item.
FIX	Corrected the name of the item.

BUG	Teldryn Brenur and Dranas Dradas, two Camonna Tong members located on the rooftop of the Council Club should not speak negatively about the Camonna Tong ("The Camonna Tong...not very nice people.").
FIX	Added an extra condition to the dialogue (Not Faction|Camonna Tong|=|1).

BUG	Apelles Matius talks about himself in third person (Apelles Matius topic). Since he is no Khajiit he should not be doing this.
FIX	Filtered dialogue correctly (Not ID|Apelles Matius|=|1).

BUG	Elone in Seyda Neen reveales that she is a member of the Blades before the player has joined this faction (background topic).
FIX	Filtered the dialogue correctly (Function|Same Faction|=|1).

BUG	The condition on all reputation-based verbal greetings is wrong, and actually checks the reputation of the NPC instead of the reputation of the player when deciding which greeting to use.
FIX	NPCs should now greet the player properly, according to the player's reputation.

BUG	Male Dunmer verbal greetings are in the wrong order, which means the player will never hear the greetings associated with higher levels of fame.
FIX	Male Dunmer should now greet the player properly, according to the player's reputation.

BUG	The "Orvas Dren" topic is available for Orvas Dren himself, making him talk about himself in third person.
FIX	Added a condition so that this topic is no longer available for Orvas Dren.

BUG	"Thank you, Please Come Again."
FIX	GMST:sBarterDialog5: |Thank you, Please Come Again.| ==> |Thank you, please come again.|

BUG	“Green lichen is a hardy primitive plant with modest magical properties that grows in the Ascadian Isles and Azura's Coast.” Issue: locations are not consistent with this description. Kresh fiber, black anther, black lichen, gold kanet, red lichen, saltrice, stoneflower also have this problem - with varying degrees.
FIX	Altered the dialogue to be consistent with where they can be found.

BUG	Carnius Magius should not have a Stalhrim Mace, as per the story you are the only person to have Stalhrim.
FIX	Replaced the mace with an Ebony Mace.

BUG	MS_Nuccius, Index 100 "I bought a cursed ring from Vodunius Nuccius so he would have enough gold to leave Morrowind. I hope I have better luck with the ring, and with my adventures in Morrowind, than he did." Narsis is part of the Morrowind province and Vodunius Nuccius is unhappy in Vvardenfell. He lives in Narsis and want to go there.
FIX	|to leave Morrowind| ==> |to leave Vvardenfell|

BUG	Drarayne Girith (the Dunmer who runs the Plot and Plaster in Tel Aruhn) incorrectly claims that the Plot and Plaster rents out beds.
FIX	|We rent beds, and I have a limited selection of goods for barter.| ==> |We have no rooms available, but downstairs is the opportunity to relax and enjoy a drink. I have a limited selection of goods for barter.|

BUG	Ajira tells you that Ashirbadon is west of Bal Fell, even though your target is actually to the east.
FIX	|east| ==> |west|

BUG	Maurrie incorrectly states that Pelagiad is to the north, when in fact, it is to the south ("jewels" topic).
FIX	Corrected.

BUG	When you return to speak with Larrius Varo after killing the Camonna Tong to receive your reward members, there's a small spelling mistake if you manage to do so without obtaining a bounty. The bit in question is this: "...You are far more discrete..." Should be discreet in this case, which would mean something is low-key or inconspicuous. Discrete doesn't make sense in this case because it means that something is distinct. It's a very commonly used mistake.
FIX	|discrete| ==> |discreet|

BUG	"You're got corprus disease, outlander. That's a death sentence. It can't get cured. Get away from me. FAR away."
FIX	|You're got| ==> |You've got|

BUG	In 19 places a comma is used in a number containing four or more digits. Since it’s a style choice whether you use commas in four-digit numbers it would be better to remove them in these few cases, for the sake of uniformity.
FIX	Corrected.

Topic=Hospitality Papers:ID=angaredhel:Journal_Hospitality Papers>=1: |told you must| ==> |told you. You must|
Topic=wild nix hounds:ID=falanu indaren:Journal_MV_MissingCompanion<15: |the were| ==> |there were|
Topic=work:ID=larrius varro:Disp=30: |discrete| ==> |discreet|
Topic=Services:Cell=Sadrith Mora:Not Class Guard=1 and Not Local NoLore=0: |at Council Hall| ==> |at the Council Hall|

								 Patch for Purists v2.9 patch notes [January 18th, 2017]
========================================================================================================================

BUG	Returning to Tuls Valen with the Cure Blight potion will cause the Compassion quest never to complete, since the dialogue script attempts to update the quest to non-existent stage 110. This means that the full disposition and faction reputation rewards can never be obtained.
FIX	Added the correct quest stage to Tuls' dialogue (Journal TT_Compassion 100).

BUG	Siding with Sosia and killing Hlormar when he attacks you will result in the Recovering Cloudcleaver quest not being counted as completed in the journal.
FIX	The quest can now be completed when you decide to side with Sosia.

BUG	If you do not have the recipe in your inventory, each time you ask Big Helende about potion recipe, a new one will be added to the chest in the upper level of Anis' shop (Potion Recipe quest).
FIX	Fixed by added a new condition to Big Helende's response to the topic ("We don't usually do..."), and gave her a proper alternative to prevent repetition ("So do you have the potion recipe?").

BUG	The 'service' topic in Dagon Fel refers to Hjotra the Peacock as being a 'he'. This is a wrong gender reference.
FIX	Changed 'he' to 'she'.

BUG	The sign for the Elven Nations Cornerclub, in the Hlaalu Waistworks of Vivec, is for some odd reason owned by "ordinator wander", resulting in a crime when activated.
FIX	Removed ownership.

BUG	In the vanilla game, the smoke that comes from chimneys is bugged, resulting in white animation textures where he should actually be grey (according to the designated textures). This is especially noticeable during the night.
FIX	Fixed the responsible animation files (chimney_smoke_green.nif, chimney_smoke_small.nif, chimney_smoke02.nif).

BUG	There is part of a stone (terrain_rock_bc_11) stucking out of a tree in Sedya Neen.
	Bitter Coast Region -7400, -70197, 124 [0, 0, 251] (-1, -9)

FIX	Changed "Temple members..." to "Cult members..." in the Imperial Cult dialogue.

BUG	Some dialogue in the 'transport to Mournhold' ("Well, that's what you'll need...") should not be said when after you've been in Mournhold.
FIX	Added conditions to the dialogue (Journal TR_DBAttack <60).

BUG	Five greeting enteries (in Greeting 4 and 5) have "But %faction won't be pleased..." instead of "But the %faction won't be pleased".
FIX	Corrected.

BUG	Several enteries in the 'other cults' topic have "cult" spelled without a capital letter, where it would be appropriate ("The Daedric cult worship...", "The Imperial cult are...").
FIX	Corrected.

BUG	In the 'little advice' topic one enterie misses the word "at" ("Keep a good sense of your surroundings...").
FIX	Corrected.

BUG	There is a typing error (there're) in one enterie 'little advice' topic enterie ("The further from civilization you go...").
FIX	Corrected.

General Fixes

BUG	Speaking to Sinnammu Mirpal about Rels Tenim will open the dialog option "cross the water", which will in turn open "accompany you" and allow you to get Mirpal to follow you, expecting to get to Ald Daedroth.

========================================================================================================================
								 Patch for Purists v2.4 patch notes [October 2nd, 2017]
========================================================================================================================

BUG	Cursed items will not stack with regular counterparts in your inventory or a container.
FIX	Cursed Items are now stackable with their regular counterparts made possible by new scripts.

BUG	Floating rock and comberry plant in Vivec region.
	Vivec (2,-10) 23997 -76260 378
	Vivec (2,-10) 23145 -76924 246
FIX	Corrected.

BUG	Some barnacles sticking out of the stones on which they are stuck in the water at Vivec.
	Ascadian Isles Region (4,-9) 36737 -71077 -27
	Ascadian Isles Region (4,-9) 38899 -67705 -9
FIX	Moved barnacles ingame to rest in correct positions.

BUG	Guards remain hostile when removing your bounty.
FIX	Removed SetFight 100 from guards' death warrant greeting and ordinator's armor greetings.

BUG	The 'travel together' topic has the potential of jumpstarting the second official Twin Lamps quest before it has been offered. The entries filtered for Hides His Foot under the topic 'go free' suggest this was not Bethesda's intention. 
FIX	Added an additional filter Journal: HH_TwinLamps3 >= 10.

BUG	There are two dialogues about Councilor Sarethi accepting you. Both are set to 30 Disposition causing one not showing up.
FIX	Set one of the dialogues to 70 Disposition.

BUG	There is a wrong gender reference in the "latest rumors" topic by Mevil Molor ("Mavon Drenim heard...") about Mavon Drenim falsely addresses him as she.
FIX	Corrected.

BUG	While executing a writ, Bretons in the Telvanni canton tower will greet you with a wrong gender reference to Mavon Drenim ("You're from the...").
FIX	Corrected.

BUG	Thavere Vedrano talks about Processus Vitellius as if he was not her husband ("I've heard that...", "These Imperial tax...").
FIX	Corrected by adding a Not ID to these dialogues.

BUG	Two Service Refusal dialogues showing up as if you were a faction member when you're not.
Info ID #786912151253629496
Filter [Race: Bosmer; Faction: Morag Tong; Rank: Brother; Function: Same Faction = 0; Function: Faction Rank Difference < -3]: "No, I'm afraid not, %PCName. My premium services are one of the sweet privileges of rank for the %Faction members."
Filter [Race: Wood Elf; Faction: Hlaalu; Rank: House Cousin; Function: Same Faction = 0; Function: Faction Rank Difference < -3]: "No, I'm afraid not, %PCName. My premium services are one of the sweet privileges of rank for the %Faction members."
FIX	Both are filtered for Function: Same Faction = 1. This is clear from the developers' notes in dialog results.

BUG	Balyn Omavel's house is named Balyn Omarel's house.
FIX	Balyn Omavel was renamed Balyn Omarel (after his house) and dialogue accordingly. This is done because renaming the house cell screws up the progression of Mephala's Quest and caused issues with compatibility. 

BUG	Rararyn Radarys' house is named Rarayn Radarys' house.
FIX	Rararyn Radarys was renamed Rarayn Radarys (after his house).

BUG	Certain NPCs will give the player the "Who's there? (Goodbye)" message, as if they do not detect the player.
FIX	Filtered the additional greeting for "a shady smuggler" instead of simply deleting it, what could cause a lot of problems due to Morrowind's dialog structure.

BUG	There are multiple problems with the Ienas Sarandas quest. Only two of the three options of completing this quest work. Also if disposition is over 60 you only get the "friendly advice" option, regardless of what is in your inventory, but Ienas will give the response as if you quoted from the book Saryoni's Sermons.
FIX	Now the quest can be completed with all three options, and Ienas no longer refers to Saryoni's Sermons if you didn't quote from the book.

BUG	Borwen, a Bosmer scout NPC, is part of the Ashlander Faction. She will respond to the Dunmer topic as if she were Dunmer but to her race topic she will say she is Bosmer.
FIX	Removed Ashlander Faction from Borwen.
BUG	A floating wall in Caldera near Buckmoth Legion Fort.
	Caldera (-2,2) -10986 21608 1856
FIX	Fixed by lowering the complete wall just a little.

BUG	 There is a room in the first section of Odirniran below the floor that is not connected to any part of the map, and thus inaccessible. It contains two levelled undead but nothing else of note. An interesting side effect of this is that even after you have killed all the accessible hostiles in the tower, there will still be two that show up when you use a Detect Animal effect, and you will not be able to sleep in most of the area, as the game thinks you're still in danger. Probably an overlook by the developers.
FIX	Removed the creatures in the basement.

BUG	Staff of the Silver Dawn appears as Silver Staff in-game. 
FIX	Fixed by giving the Staff of the Silver Dawn it's correct name.

BUG	If you refuse to help Aurane Frernis the topic will disappear and the Roland's Tear quest will still open forever. 
FIX	Created a dialogue loop where Aurane asks again for help. When the quest ends the topic "gold kanet flower" will disappear as it should be.

BUG	The True Flame sword functions as a torch when drawn. But if you have hotkeyed another weapon and switch to that without sheathing Trueflame, the light it generates will remain.
FIX	Now the light will be correctly removed when the weapon is equipped but isn’t drawn.

BUG	Two new texture files in the Tribunal and Bloodmoon .bsa archives have the same names as files in the Morrowind archive. These new textures are very different to the originals but unintentionally affect the appearance of some Morrowind meshes.
FIX	Corrected.

BUG	Tribunal and Bloodmoon together add four new creature summons, but the spell and effect icons do not share the exact style of the original game
FIX	Added new icons which no longer look out of place next to the originals.

BUG	In-game dialogues describe Nix-Hound as "a rangy quadruped with long, purple feeding spikes", but in the actual game its mandibles appear green.
FIX	Corrected this inconstistence by modifying the Nix-Hound mesh.

BUG	The Nix-Hound has a buggy knock-out animation.
FIX	Corrected.

BUG	Grahl have a glow map to make their eyes glow in the dark but the surrounding skin around the eye is also glowing.
FIX	Corrected.

BUG	When a Hunger is knocked out, it starts to emit a horrible noise.
FIX	Corrected by removing the offending instruction from the looped frame.

BUG	Static NPC's will slowly drift from their original positions.
FIX	Corrected animation.

BUG	Wolf armor groins are backwards.	
FIX	Corrected.

BUG	Glass and Templar helms clip with certain heads.
FIX	Corrected.

BUG	Ebony armor has greenish tinges.
FIX	Corrected.

BUG	The cabin of the shipwreck 'Prelude' has a level 40 lock on the inside, meaning if you can't pick it, you're stuck.
FIX	Changed the lock to the outside.

BUG	Redoran Hortator dialogue corresponds to Hlaalu Hortator quest state; Crassius Curio thinks you've finished Redoran Hortator quests when you didn't.
FIX	Changed the response to check B5_RedoranHort instead of B6_HlaaluHort.

BUG	Bethesda included more specific endgame dialogue, which was not visible because it was badly filtered.
FIX	Corrected.

BUG	Buoyant Armigers didn't give you a disposition increase.
FIX	Corrected.

BUG	There is a possibility in the Tribunal Main Quest where Karrod does not respond to the player properly when asked for the "pieces of the blade" after the player beats him in the duel.
FIX	Corrected.

BUG	There is a dialog glitch where Fast Eddie mistakenly doesn't do chores after the player becomes the Telvanni Archmagister.
FIX	Corrected.

BUG	In the Ralen Hlaalo murder quest, under certain conditions, it is possible to get an unlimited amount of 1000 Golds reward by Nileno Dorvayn.
FIX	Fixed the script properly, so the reward will be only given once.

BUG	Dinok will give infinite portions of scrib jelly if you get the "scrib jelly" topic.
FIX	Filtered his response correctly.

BUG	Edwinna Elbert, in the Ald-ruhn Mages Guild, would not accept a rare book (Secrets of Dwemer Animunculi)and react accordingly in a number of cases, including if you had completed any duties for her, or were the Arch-Mage.
FIX	Corrected.

BUG	When you kill Fjol first before talking with Varo you get stuck with the active quest.
FIX	Change the requirement for getting dialogue (latest rumor) from Varo in Moonmoth.

BUG	Geon Auline automatically says goodbye when you try to deliver a potion of cure common disease  to him (Crimson Plague), if you refused his previous quest (Estate Sale).
FIX	Added a filter to his greeting so he will no longer automatically say goodbye when you try to deliver a potion of cure common disease  to him (Journal|MS_CrimsonPlague|!=|20).

BUG	During the Tribunal questline (TR_MissingHand), you are offered a choice of enhancements from Almalexia.  Under certain circumstances the options you receive would change, however even selecting the new option you would get the same result.
FIX	Fixed by altering altering the "missing Hand" topic, so that the available option is selectable and you receive the cooresponding bonus.

BUG	If you killed the Wraith of Sul-Senipul without taking the Bonebiter Bow of Sul-Senipul, and his corpse has disappeared or if you lost the bow in some other way, you will be unable to further progress in the Main Quest.
FIX	Makes the corpse of Wraith of Sul-Senipul persistent, and gives you a message when you kill it.

BUG	If you pick up the Airship Captain's Journal before talking to Louis Beauchamp, he will not acknowledge that you have the book.
FIX	Adds the "my airship" topic when you pick up the journal.

BUG	If you do the Mazed Band quest before the Journalist (The Common Tongue) quest when you are sent to talk Barenziah she has nothing new to say to you and you miss certain important topics ('whom you may trust' and 'Plitinius Mero').  This is because once you do the Mazed Band Quest, Barenziah stops at the greeting "Good day to you. How may I help you, %PCName?" and never reaches the "I've been wanting to talk to you." greeting.
FIX	Added a global variable that doesn't show the "Good Day" until you have seen the other.

BUG	You are ordered to wear your uniform in order to be recognised as a Legion Member. Three Imperial armors did not show your membership because they were missing the required script.
FIX	Added the missings script to Imperial Dragonscale Cuirass, Imperial Newtscale Cuirass, and Imperial Silver Cuirass.

BUG	Imperial Templar pauldrons by Bethesda did not show up in-game.
FIX	Corrected.

BUG	Ten Pace Boots model does not show up when wearing them because it is not broken up into foot and ankle like boots are meant to be.
FIX	Corrected the model.

BUG	Two plants in the Andus Tradehouse poke through the stairs.     
FIX	Corrected.

BUG	Fort Pelagiad’s disappears at times.
FIX	Corrected.

BUG	The floor at the end of Sethan Ancestor Tomb is a bit broken - you can see through gaps.    
FIX	Corrected.

BUG	Bouyant Armigers do not properly mention their faction and rank in dialog.
FIX	Corrected.

BUG	When you mouse over the "East Empire Company" entry in the Factions section of your character window, it gives weirdness when you get to the top of a Faction.
FIX	Corrected.

BUG	In Morrowind you are not allowed to rest in towns or cities, however this is not true for Ald Velothi.
FIX	Made resting in Ald Velothi illegal.

BUG	The fog setting in The Dome of Serlyn room in Sotha Sil can cause a "blank screen" issue on the machines with ATI Radeon cards.
FIX	Corrected.

BUG	The noise in the "magic sound" (Fx\magic\sound.wav) was left unused for some reason.
FIX	The player will hear an actual noise when he's under the effects of the Sound magic. Its volume depends on the total magnitude of the effect.

BUG	Vampire spells like Vampire Touch, Porphyric Hemophilia and several others, while added to vampire NPCs on the initial setup, became missing after save and reload, which, among other things, made getting vampire disease from them impossible.
FIX	Fixed by adjusting the responsible script.

BUG	Daedra Skin is (with only one exception) never found on any actual Daedra. Daedra Skin is not included in any levelled lists, and as such it is very difficult to find.
FIX	Fixed several inconsistencies between the game world and the game lore. Daedra Skin is now randomly available on Clannfears, Daedroth, Ogrims, Ogrim Titans, and Hungers. Ghoul Hearts are now randomly available on Ash Ghouls.

BUG	Heartwood is not available on Spriggans after level 3, effectively making it unavailable in the game.
FIX	Modifies the levelled list <code>random_belladonna_spriggan</code> levelled list to be calculated for all levels instead of only whatever level the PC is at.

BUG	The last type of Holly Bush (<code>Flora_BM_holly_06</code>) is not set to be respawning like all others.
FIX	Corrected.

BUG	Horn Lily (<code>Flora_plant_01</code>) is not set to be respawning, so that it can be gathered without having to buy it.
FIX	Corrected.

BUG	Staada was not persistent. This could break Azura's quest.
FIX	Staada is persistent now.

BUG	Dialogue with NPC Satyana falls into an endless loop if one has Agustas' amulet in one's inventory but has NOT taken her quest.
FIX	The two greetings in Satyana's "Greeting 5" dialogue that depend on the "choice" variable now depend on "choice" only, and NOT anymore on Journal MS_ArenimTomb >= 50.

BUG	Journal IL_Smuggler stage 10: missing "and" in the 2nd sentence.
FIX	Added "and". Also, put "return" in quotes for obvious reasons.

BUG	NPC "vivec_god"'s dialogue topic "remember being mortal": In the first reply, a dot is missing.
FIX	Inserted dot.

BUG	If you do not talk to NPC Kurapli before you become Urshilaku Nerevarine, you will not be able to start his quest "Kurapli Seeks Justice" anymore-
FIX	Changed Kurapli's first two Greeting 5's in order to include the word "discuss". (This word should then add the topic "discuss", which starts the quest.)

BUG	Dialogue topic "arrange a meeting": Minabibi's last response ("Yes, I will speak with Skink-in-Tree's-Shade...") is missing a "to" in the "strong enough fight it" part.
FIX	Added "to".

BUG	Several interconnected bugs in NPC "Lalatia Varian"'s Greetings 5:
1) There are three greetings beginning with "%Rank %PCName, the healer Urjorad..."; they have identic greeting text and identic results but different conditions. One of them (the second one) is completely enough. The others are of no use, but actually are of harm: They are responsible for the bugs that are triggered when the player visits Rotheran and rescues Adusamsi Assurnarairan too early (i. e., before obtaining the Ice Blade quest from the Oracle). As a result of these bugs, the quest "Imperial Cult: Ice Blade of the Monarch" is never removed from the journal (because the only Finishing stages are in IC27_Oracle, and these stages are never reached); besides, the player misses out on 1-2 rep points and Adusamsi's Ring, as well as on some disposition from the Oracle and on 5 faction reputation. And the next quest (Scroll of Fiercely Roasting) becomes much harder, because the dialogue topic "Ashalmimilkala", which details the path to the ruin, doesn't become blue.
2) These three greetings have an obvious error: %Rank instead of %PCRank.
3) If one has rescued Adusamsi Assurnarairan and talks to Lalatia WITHOUT the Ice Blade in one's inventory, Lalatia thinks the player has not found the Ice Blade, and gives him 1 rep point only (instead of 2 rep points as he would get if he had the Ice Blade with him). This is a problem for everyone who has rescued Adusamsi without obtaining the quest from Lalatia, because there is no way to know one should take the Ice Blade except from this quest.
FIX	Out of the three identic greetings, the first one has been defanged (by adding a new condition, which NEVER holds); the third one has been completely replaced by a different one - namely by a "Adusamsi Assurnarairan has told me how you rescued her..." condition that is supposed to catch the case when the player has rescued Adusamsi without embarking on Lalatia's Oracle quest. This should solve 1) and 3). Also, the second greeting has been fixed, solving 2).

BUG	Vivyne Andrano will never get the sleeper greetings after the first because the player can never get at sleeperScript distance in that small cell that is St. Delyn Canton.
FIX	Lowered the distance in the script needed to trigger the greetings (3000 ? 1024).

BUG	Quest MS_BlackDart stage 50 incorrectly gives the location of the Black Dart gangsters.
FIX	Replaced location by "ruined sewers".

BUG	Quest BM_Sun stage 20 has a grammar mistake ("is" should be "are").
FIX	Replaced "is" by "are".

BUG	Greeting 1, thormoor_thirsk, ID: 2467914181324123642, “%PCName! I've had some time to rest,…” has, in its result script, a ShowMap instruction with an invalid destination cell.
FIX	Changed “ShowMap "Solstheim, Gyldenhul"” to “ShowMap "Solstheim, Gyldenhul Barrow Entrance"”

BUG	Greeting 1, thormoor_thirsk, ID: 3187114073240217891, “%PCName! I've had some time to rest,…” has, in its result script, a ShowMap instruction with an invalid destination cell.
FIX	Changed “ShowMap "Solstheim, Gyldenhul"” to “ShowMap "Solstheim, Gyldenhul Barrow Entrance"”.

BUG	Greeting 1, thormoor_out, ID: 71382752095631387, “%PCName! I've had some time to rest,…” has, in its result script, a ShowMap instruction with an invalid destination cell..
FIX	Changed “ShowMap "Solstheim, Gyldenhul"” to “ShowMap "Solstheim, Gyldenhul Barrow Entrance"”.

FIX	Tent scaled to 1.1.

BUG	Levelled creature in_dae_all_lev+0 in Salothan Ancestral Tomb spawns too close to a door, sometimes preventing the door from opening.
FIX	Levelled creature in_dae_all_lev+0 is now further from the door, which should make this BUG less likely.

FIX	Moved this pathspear and a few other statics closeby.

BUG	In cave Mat, a misc_com_bottle_15 stuck floating in the bottom of ex_de_shack_steps. (in the first open 'room' upon entering).
FIX	Moved the bottle to a slightly more sensible location.

BUG	Doors out of Assemanu, Shrine were locked with lock level 0 (i. e., could only be opened with an unlock spell).

BUG	In the script assabaScript, the variables xPos and yPos were declared "short", which made the "if ( xPos > 84700 )" clause come to nothing (a short cannot be > 84700).

This is not a joinable faction by the PC. I was unable to find any lore or reference in-game or from another Elder Scrolls series source on what this rank should be, so I chose "Liberator" as it has a historical background: The Liberator was the abolitionist newspaper of William Lloyd Garrison, founder of the largest and most organized abolitionist group in history: The American Anti-Slavery Society. The only ranks in the society that are known from its minutes, proceedings and constitution are the generic ones given any organization (member, officer, executive and vice-president;) they were not unique titles and not appropriate to a secret society. This would be consistent with the faction name "Twin Lamps" if its name is a reference to another abolitionist newspaper of the era: The SafetyLamp.]
