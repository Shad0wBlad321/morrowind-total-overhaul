Mesh replacers for MWSE Graphic Herbalism (converted by Stuporstar)
Base meshes are contained in a separate download. Make sure you install them before these.
Includes the following: these are PATCHES for existing replacers, so you need to download the original textures to use most of them.

00 Core
Contains fixed and cleaned versions of Correct UV Diverse Ore Replacer
The respawning version restores ore respawning - you only need to load one version of the esp

01 Pherim's Replacers - SOME REQUIRE TEXTURES
If using an installer, install this patch after original mods - or just install their textures
You don't need to install the old GH meshes included in Pherim's mods, but they won't cause errors

Required textures from original mods are here:
Comberry: https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/42586 - Install main folder and the vanilla textures if you prefer, ignore the Extras folder
Fire Fern: https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43568 - Install any option you prefer, ignore the old GH folder
Hackle-lo: https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/42784 - Install only the main folder
Kwama Eggs: https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43555 - Only install the first folder of Pherim's Kwama Eggs, and the bump maps if you use them

The comberry version without reflection maps is GH's default. For shiny berries choose the the reflect subfolder
The next set of Pherim folders contain optional versions
02 Pherim Reflection Mapped (requires Pherims reflection maps) - install this on top of folder 01 Pherim's Replacers
03 Pherim Pulsing Kwama (no textures necessary) - you only need one version of the kwama egg sac replacer...
04 Pherim Pulsing Kwama Reflect (requires Pherims reflection maps)

05 Vurt's Chokeweed & Roobrush - REQUIRES TEXTURES - Install After Vurt's Leafy West Gash II
If you're only using these meshes from Vurt's Leafy West Gash II, you only need to install those textures along with these meshes.

The textures included in this folder are for the picked state only because they weren't included in the original mod.

This mod still requires Vurt's original textures, found in Vurt's Leafy West Gash II: http://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/37400/?

06 Less Epic Plants - TEXTURES INCLUDED - requires gherb textures found in base GH archive
by Stuporstar - a lower poly alternative to some Epic Plants meshes.
They're included separately from the other smoothed meshes because they require new textures.
I included the textures because they're mine (no permission issues), so no extra download is necessary.

This package includes:
Spiny Lloramor - actually has spines
Whispy Wheat - properly three-dimensional

############################
07 Slightly Less Epic Plants - TEXTURES INCLUDED - Less Epic Plants REQUIRED

Better-looking versions with alpha blending turned
If these hit the game's performance too hard, go back and install Less Epic Plants instead

Credit goes to Articus for letting me use the leaves from his wickwheat meshes.

###########################################
08 Glowing Bitter Coast - REQUIRE GLOWMAPS
If using an installer, install this patch after Glowing Bitter Coast - or just install the textures
This replacer covers coda flowers and mushrooms, so you still need it if you're using the atlas mushrooms listed next

You need either the original glowmaps found here: http://mw.modhistory.com/download-44-14321
Or glowmaps with the same file name from another replacer.

09 Glowing Bitter Coast Smoothed - choose one or the other, not both - same requirements

###########################################
10 Atlas - Vanilla BC Mushrooms - REQUIRE ATLAS TEXTURES - Install after Project Atlas BC Mushrooms
12 Atlas - Smoothed BC Mushrooms - Choose one version or the other
11 Atlas - Glowing Bitter Coast Patch - Install AFTER Glowing Bitter Coast
13 Atlas - Smoothed Glowmap Patch - Choose one or the other for selected version

Want even more of a performance boost with MWSE Graphic Herbalism? Check out Project Atlas - https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45399

Download the original BC Mushrooms archive and use the atlas generator on your texture replacer of choice. (Note - Epic Plants textures need resizing to work with the generator.)

Vanilla: generate the vanilla atlas using bc_mushrooms_atlas_generator.bat
Smooth: generate both atlas textures using bc_fungus_atlas_generator.bat and bc_mushroom_only_atlas_generator.bat

If you use Glowing Bitter Coast, load it AND the base atlas option of your choice, AND its corresponding glowmap patch - in that order.
You don't need either Glowing Bitter Coast Patch from the Atlas archive, because it's just the same meshes replaced by this one.

###########################################
14 Remiros shelf fungus - REQUIRE TEXTURES
If using an installer, install this patch after original mod - or just install its textures

Original textures for Bungler's Bane and Hypha Facia HD are found here - https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45639

These are loaded last so if you prefer them they'll overwrite the atlas shelf fungus.

###########################################
15 Apel's Azura's Coast - REQUIRE TEXTURES - Install After Apel's Asura Coast and Sheogorath Retexture

These plants are all covered in the smoothed meshes folder, but Apel's overhaul uses renamed textures, found here - https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/42573
Base mucksponges don't have bumpmaps - removed for openMW users.

16 Apel's Mucksponge Bumpmapped - REQUIRE Apel's BUMPMAPS - load it along with the previous Apel folder

The bumpmapped versions don't have failure states because the extra node + reflection mapping made the game CTD, so it's one or the other.

###########################################
17 Trama Bumpmapped - REQUIRE BUMPMAPS - NOT RECOMMENDED
If using Installers, install after Lougain's Trama Bumpbapped - or just install its textures

NOT COMPATIBLE WITH OPENMW

I don't recommend using these meshes in any case, unless you want saran-wrapped trama root: https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43015

Lougain's textures can be used with any of the other trama root meshes - I recommend the smoothed versions in the base archive.

###########################################
18 Ascadian Isles Plants - REQUIRE TEXTURES - NOT RECOMMENDED

These meshes are horrible but apparently people still use them, and the GH meshes are optimized as much as possible.
Comberry not included because it was too much of a horrible unoptimized mess and impossible to convert with a billion billboarded berries. Use Pherim's instead.

###########################################
19 Glass Glowset ores - REQUIRE GLOWMAPS
If using an installer, install this patch after Glass Glowset - or just install the textures

If you use the Glass Glowset, these meshes are so you still get glowing glass ore, but they'll work with any texture named tx_raw_glass_01_g.dds

Glass Glowest can be found here: https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/42762

Ore Diversity meshes are also included.

20 Vanilla Meshes for MC or STA

This folder contains meshes made harvestable by other mods such as Morrowind Crafting and ST Alchemy.
Folder includes: cavern plant, kelp, moss, and spider webs.

21 Cave Plant Replacer for MC - ORIGINAL TEXTURES REQUIRED
Cave plant is from Pherim's Improved Cavern Clutter, and requires the textures found here: https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44321

22 Kelp Replacer for MC or STA - ORIGINAL TEXTURES RECOMMENDED
The kelp textures are optional, but Slartibartfast's work best for these meshes, and can be found here: http://mw.modhistory.com/download-56-11998

ST Alchemy: http://download.fliggerty.com/download--1093
Morrowind Crafting: http://mw.modhistory.com/download-53-10477
