I know I am not the only one to wonder why Bethesda didn't make a Snow Bear shield or why the wolf shiel looks like what a Snow Wolf shield would look like if there was one.  So I waited to see if anyone was going to make them...I got tired of waiting.  I retextured the Wolf Shield and made a Snow Wolf shield out of the original texture.  Then I made a Snow bear shield.  I tried to make the stats as close as what they would be if Bethesda made them.  You can get the shields the same way you get the rest of the armor.  For those of you that don't know, this requires Bloodmoon.  Feel free to use this in any of your mods, but I would like a little credit, please and thank you.

To play with this mod just put the files in the proper folders (example: icons go in the icons folder etc) and put the esp file in the Data Files folder.  After that just activate it on the plug-in list and enjoy your new snow armor.

P.S.:  Thanks to Bethesda for making such a great game!
