Skyrim: Home of the Nords Readme

The Imperial Legion maintains a border wall between Dragonstar East, ruled by Jarl Jona the Ansei-Ender, and Dragonstar West, a Crown holding surrounded almost entirely by the Kingdom of the Reach.  Residents of the cities are forbidden from crossing the wall due to threats of constant violence, something they know too well.  Outside the cities, life goes on for the Reachmen of the Alovach and Taliesinn tribes; however, they keep one ear to the ground. If war were to again break out in Dragonstar, they would inevitably be dragged in...

Dragonstar West's Guild of Mages chapter, distrusted by the local population, struggles to maintain its image and waning membership. The Thieves Guild has its eyes on some big prizes and is rumored to be holed up in Dragonstar East.  The Dragonstar Arena is filled with nervous spectators hungry for combatants to offer a distraction from every-day life...

Beyond the walls, the Reach is as dangerous as ever.  Merchants continue to be attacked by bandits and Reachmen, ferocious beasts stalk the forests and mesas, and bound servants patrol the fortresses of both Clan Direnni and the First Era Nords...

The Skyrim: Home of the Nords Team is proud to present another release in our efforts to create the province of Skyrim as envisioned in the world of TESIII: Morrowind. It represents the work of many talented modders over the past years and includes the following features:

- 100+ quests, including new regional questlines for the Imperial Guilds, bounty hunting, and miscellaneous quests
- 290+ exterior cells of hand-crafted landscape.
- 330+ interior cells, including the massive cities of Karthwasten and Dragonstar, towns, camps, and dozens of locations for you to loot in classic TES fashion.
- Specially-modeled exterior and interior assets to flesh out the settlements of the Reach, including Reachman camps, Direnni ruins, and ancient fortresses.
- New books, armor, clothing, weapons, and more.

----------------------------
i. Installing the Mod:
----------------------------
- Open the "00 Core" folder and copy its contents into your Data Files folder in your Morrowind folder.
- Optional: Open the "01 Grass for MGEXE and OpenMW" folder and copy its contents into your Data Files folder.
- Download Tamriel_Data v. 9.0 or newer and copy all contained folders and their files into your Data Files folder.
- Register your BSAs: https://www.tamriel-rebuilt.org/about/frequently-asked-questions/bsa
- Enable Tamrriel_Data and Sky_Main.esm in your launcher. 
- If you use MGE and you wish to use MGE-animated grass, do not enable the Sky_Main_Grass.esp in the launcher. Only use it when generating distant lands. We do not recommend using this esp with OpenMW since it does not optimize grass in the way MGE XE does or animate the grass.

----------------------------
ii. Updating Save Games:
----------------------------
(Save files created before v. 22.11 will not work with 22.11 or 23.02!)

If you are updating SHotN, and intend on resuming play using an existing save-game, you must first run the file patcher contained in Tamriel_Data download.

If you are playing on the vanilla engine (Morrowind.exe), then you must undertake the additional steps outlined here (http://wiki.theassimilationlab.com/mmw/Wrye_Mash#Using_an_Updated_Version_of_a_Mod) to resolve any potential errors when using an old save-game on a newer version of SHotN. Please note, you will need to download and install the Wyre Mash utility to clean and repair your savegame using the method above as well as a Java Runtime Engine to use the file patcher.

----------------------------
iii. Playing the Mod:
----------------------------
Speak with Jurid Fast-Travel at the Dagon Fel docks to travel to the Karthwasten docks, or speak with Bronding Wind-Catcher to travel back to Dagon Fel.

----------------------------
iv. Known issues:
----------------------------
- The ingame map will not follow the player to the new landmass in vanilla Morrowind. It only works with OpenMW.
- NPCs, creatures, and the player vibrate in vanilla Morrowind due to loss of floating point precision. OpenMW significantly mitigates this issue.

----------------------------
v. Future Updates:
----------------------------
The next full release will see the completion of the entire Reach and the additions of Markarth Side, Beorinhal, and Old Hrol'dan.  A significant number of quests will be added, headlined by the Reach's main quest which will embroil the player in the political machinations of a succession crisis.

----------------------------
vi. About SHotN:
----------------------------
We have been working on bringing the lands of Skyrim to TES:III for ten years. The Skyrim we aim to make is our own interpretation, rather than a copy of Bethesda’s work in TES:V. Based on lore from the Pocket Guides to the Empire and other additional sources, we’ve based our creations on what you might expect from having played Morrowind rather than later games in the series. A comprehensive and sustained effort from model-makers, landscape designers, interior-fiddlers and quest-wranglers has allowed for this latest release.

If you would like to join us in the effort to bring Skyrim to life, please find us at https://project-tamriel.com/. 
Alternatively, come hang out in the Project Tamriel Discord: https://discord.gg/waZcqnF, the best place to chat with our team and catch up on our latest progress.
