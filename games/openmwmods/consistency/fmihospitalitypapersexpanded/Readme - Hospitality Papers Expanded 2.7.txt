Hospitality Papers Expanded 
by: PoodleSandwich

Added:

- The ability to ask people about the papers and where you can buy them
- A script to ascertain if you are the rank of Retainer or higher and thus do not require them (as according to vanilla dialogue)
- New text and audio dialogue for guards harassing you about having them (audio recorded by original voice actor Jeff Baker) 
- An increased unfriendliness from Sadrith Mora Guards in general, especially if you are a Khajiit or Argonian
- Guards now confiscate your papers if you're caught breaking the law
- The papers cost more
- There is a penalty for losing them or having them confiscated (you will have to pay a lot more for a new copy)
- Additional relevant dialogue and tweaks to the dialogue for NPCs at the Gateway Inn, including the Prefect of Hospitality
- Edited the text of the Papers themselves so that they make sense and are free of typos and grammatical errors
- Created unique texture and icon for the Papers themselves 

+ A bonus ESP that better filters guard's dialogue so that non-Imperial guards have slightly more unique greetings and responses to the topic of "Imperial Law". Also, guards will no longer play the audio line "Need I call the guards?" when they don't like you.
+ A bonus ESP to make it compatible with "Sadrith Mora Closed City" by The Bloodthirsty Crustacean. (Load SMCC after HP Expanded and load the bonus ESP after both)

Feel free to use this as a resource as long as you allow others the same freedom.


Added in 2.0:

- Newly recorded audio lines from original Morrowind Voice actor Jeff Baker, replace mashed-together lines.
- Guards no longer refer to you by your race if you are also a Dunmer.
- "sera" is no longer capitalized
- Redoran Guards in "Better Dialogue Filtering for Guards" no longer mention Imperial Law


Added in 2.5:

- Added Jeff Baker’s alternative, less stern sounding takes for higher disposition greetings (note, you might not hear these during your playthrough as the most common way of raising the disposition of Telvanni Guards is to rise through the ranks of House Telvanni, which will stop them questioning you about your papers anyway)

- Improved variety in guard’s spoken lines, including adding an alternative take that you will hear more often than the ones mentioned above

- Merged in the “Better dialogue filtering for guards” plugin

- Tightened up wording for Angaredhel’s response to you losing your papers.

- It no longer matters if you are in House Telvanni, you will still have your papers taken away if you are caught committing a crime by a Sadrith Mora Guard

- Telvanni guards will now greet you with more respectfully than in vanilla if you are a Magister or Archmagister

- There is no longer a sudden jump in guard’s behavior, from hating your guts to being your friend as soon as you rise high enough in the ranks of House Telvanni. It should now be a more gradual warming.

- Changed Guard’s lines “I am an officer of Hlaalu/Redoran” to “I am an officer of House Hlaalu/Redoran” so you can enquire about their houses more easily.

- As per Bludwurst’s suggestion, there are now 4 different service refusal lines, with varying degrees of rudeness.

- Spoken audio lines have been converted to vanilla quality to prevent issues for anyone who might be using mods that remove Male Sadrith Mora Guard’s helmets in the Original Engine. Pretty specific, but why not? The quality is not noticeably reduced. 

- Added a line of dialogue in response to the topic “Hospitality Papers” for when you are a Retainer of House Telvanni, informing you that you no longer need them.

- Turned down a couple of audio lines that were a bit loud 

- Fixed a Vanilla issue whereby the Dunmer audio greetings telling you “You’ve betrayed the clan… watch your back!” weren’t filtered properly for PC faction expulsion, meaning they would sometimes play when you had not been expelled.


2.6 Update:

- Different disposition mods depending on how badly diseased you are when first entering the town carrying a disease
- Added more respectful greetings and hello lines for the rank of Master
- Filtered the rank based greetings to make sure you don’t hear them if you are expelled.
- J’Jazha now only has the topic “Hospitality Papers” if you don’t have them
- Added back plugin description

2.7 Update:

- The new audio lines are now in the "Vo" folder, and the esp has been updated by SuperQuail to point to that location. This means they can now be heard in the original engine instead of just in OpenMW.
