Description
============
One of MW's quests has voiced dialogue that sends you to a totally  different location than where the quest actually takes place (and completely contradicts the journal, for that matter). Without a bag of money, it is not easy to hire Wes Johnson (the voice actor) to rectify this. Redoing the voice by someone else would be lame, right?

So I just put the cave entrance in a more logical location; so that this glaring and immersion-breaking inconsistency is fixed.
• Directions in the journal now correspond to the dialogue.
• Mount Assarnibibi will be marked on your map as soon as the quest begins.
• Removed any sign of the previous entrance in the Grazelands.
• No landscape edits were made.

*SPOILER ALERT*
When doing the "A Cure for Vampirism" quest for Molag Bal, his dialogue says that Molag Grunda is found in the Caverns of Dubdilla under Mount Assernibibi. But the caverns are near Vos, and the journal tells you it is south of Vos. It does make sense that the cave Dubdilla is located below Mount Assarnibibi. According to Temple lore, this is where Molag Bal oversaw the 99 lovers of Boethiah, who gave birth to Almalexia. So there is a connection.
*END OF SPOILER*

Permissions
============
You are not allowed to convert/alter/modify/translate/improve/commercial benefit/use assets from or reupload this mod to other sites without my permission to do so first. Please get in touch with me first if you are interested in using this mod (in part or whole) in your mod. I'm pretty open about people using my stuff as a modder's resource for creating their unique mods, but I would need to see if it is along my vision or even improves on it before I can give permission.

Please do not compile and release my mods in a larger mod without permission. I am not a fan of people throwing cheap rips of my mods (with or without minor adjustments) in mod packs or compilation mods. My mods are subject to updates and expansions on a whim, so I want to keep track of comments and see if users have bug reports or feedback for the mod in question. This won't be possible if people only knew my work through a sort of compilation.
