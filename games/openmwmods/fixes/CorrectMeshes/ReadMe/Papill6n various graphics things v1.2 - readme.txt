1. Description
===============

This page contains all my creations/modifications of textures/meshes for the play Morrowind.

I love Morrowind, his atmosphere, the origin graphics of the game. 
But the game has ages and its textures appear from now on in a coarse way on our screens 24 inches :D

But especially after years, there are still some textures of the game which were never retextured thus I am occupied (some). 
And I also retextured certain things by testing the remained faithful ones to vanilla's textures.


P.s: sorry for my poor english I'm a native french speaker.
