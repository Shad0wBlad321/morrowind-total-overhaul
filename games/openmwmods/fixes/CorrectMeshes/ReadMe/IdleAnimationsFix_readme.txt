Description
============
This replacer will fix a bug that's been plaguing Morrowind since release. If you've ever played for an extended amount of time you've probably noticed how static NPC's will slowly drift from their original positions.  It's usually most apparent with the Silt Strider caravaners or guild guides, but it actually affects all NPCs in the game. Essentially what's happening is that all the idle animations are actually moving the characters very slightly, and any time there is a cell change or reload the NPC's current position is saved and the process will begin again from that new position. Over time these small adjustments add up and can cause NPCs to fall off platforms or even pass through walls, potentially ruining your game. All this mod will do is make sure that characters locations are actually static during idle animations. The animations themselves will still play as normal and everything should look the same, the only noticeable difference should be that you never have to use the reset actors command to fix NPCs whom drifted from their original location.

Animations Fixed: Idle, Idle2, Idle3, Idle4, Idle5, Idle6, Idle7, Idle8, Idle9, IdleStorm
