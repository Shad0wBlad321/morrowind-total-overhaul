     1. DESCRIPTION

***********************************************************************

This mod is pluginless mesh replacer containing a collection of 121 of Morrowinds 
original meshes that have had various issues corrected or improved on. The type
of things addressed are typically adjustments to Uv maps, repositioning of poorly 
aligned model parts, adding missing pieces, deleting/merging excessive polygons 
that are serving no useful purpose and things of that nature.There is also a bark
texture included that is a minor reworking of the original which has had highlights 
toned down to make tiling less obvious on the Telvanni exterior meshes.

Also included are some meshes from 'better meshes' by Tarius and also
'Mesh Improvements'by Armed Defender that i corrected the UV maps
should you be encountering uv problems with certain models if using those.

Screenshots showing the various tweaks and fixes applied to each of the models
are included, and you can pick precisely which fixes you want.

     2. INSTALLING THE PLUGIN

*****************************************************************

1. Copy the Meshes folder into the 'Morrowind/Data' files directory'

   answer yes when prompted to overwrite the existing folder.


2. Start playing!

   
*****************************************************************

     3. KNOWN ISSUES

*****************************************************************

UV maps have been adjusted for best effect with Morrowinds default textures.
If using textures that are of a different scale to the defaults then 
end results may not be as expected, resulting in textures looking too stretched 
or compressed by comparison in which case adjusting the scale of the UV maps 
should improve appearance
