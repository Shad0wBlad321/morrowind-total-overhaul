Arvisrend's mod fixes the following issue with the game:

BUG	Book bk_BM_StoneMap shows the Wind Stone south or northeast of the river merging, while it actually is slightly northwest of it.
FIX	Moved the Wind Stone emblem and text in magicstonemap4.dds. Being an image editing noob, I couldn't keep it from looking strange in places, but at least it is 	geographically correct now... kind of.

As stated, the fixed map looks strange in places, inconsistent with the rest of the stones. So I have gone into photoshop and touched it up.
