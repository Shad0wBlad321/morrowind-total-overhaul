Expansion Resource Conflicts - Full
v1.3
by hardek

--Description
A small number of new texture files in the Tribunal and Bloodmoon bsa archives have the same names as files in the Morrowind archive. These new textures are very different to the originals and are required for meshes in the expansions, but (apparently unintentionally) affect the appearance of some Morrowind meshes. This mod contains edited resource files which ensure the Morrowind meshes keep the original textures while the expansions' meshes use the new textures as intended. Demonstration images are available in the Examples folder.
Additionally, several texture files in the expansion archives are not new, but are copies of Morrowind files with odd or erroneous changes. Because loose files have priority over those within a bsa, the correct files are included with this to ensure they are used by the game.

--Changelog
-v1.21
Added missing mesh: In_DB_ruin02.nif.
Updated permissions, credits and contact details.
-v1.3
Updated In_DB_front.nif and Light_OM_censure.nif to Morrowind Optimisation Patch versions.

--Installation
Move the Meshes and Textures folders from this mod into the Data Files folder.
If you are using Morrowind Optimisation Patch, install this mod after and overwrite when prompted. There will only be two conflicting files.
If you are using other mods and are asked to replace files, choose no and see the Details section below.

These files were all taken directly from the bsas or game discs and have been edited as described here. They may conflict with graphical overhaul mods and similar mesh or texture replacers.

-Textures
	tx_dwrv_wall40.dds: from Morrowind.bsa, to ensure priority over Tribunal.bsa
		Original file was overridden by new texture in Tribunal.bsa
	tx_dwrv_wall40_tr.dds: tx_dwrv_wall40.dds from Tribunal.bsa, for in_dwe_weathmach00_exp.nif
		Renamed to prevent overriding Morrowind file
	tx_fireglow.dds: from Morrowind.bsa, to ensure priority over Tribunal.bsa
		Tribunal version was a copy of a different texture, vfx_fireglow.dds
	tx_firelight.dds: vfx_firelight.dds from Morrowind.bsa, to ensure priority over Tribunal.bsa
		Tribunal version was a copy of vfx_firelight.dds with broken transparency
	tx_poison_steam.dds: from Morrowind.bsa, to ensure priority over Tribunal.bsa
		Tribunal version was blank
	tx_rough_stone_wall_tr.dds: tx_rough_stone_wall.dds from Tribunal.bsa, for In_DB*.nif and In_OM*.nif
		Though the version in Bloodmoon.bsa with which this conflicts appears unused, the Tribunal meshes have been changed to ensure they use the correct texture.
	Tx_wood.dds: from Morrowind.bsa, to ensure priority over Bloodmoon.bsa
		Original file was overridden by new texture in Bloodmoon.bsa
	Tx_wood_bm.dds: Tx_wood.dds from Bloodmoon.bsa, for Heartwood.nif
		Renamed to prevent overriding Morrowind file
	vfx_restore_light.dds: from Tribunal.bsa, to ensure priority over Morrowind.bsa
		This is a more detailed texture than the Morrowind.bsa version, but is otherwise identical.
