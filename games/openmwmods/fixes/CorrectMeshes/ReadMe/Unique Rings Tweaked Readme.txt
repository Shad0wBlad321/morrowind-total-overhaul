Unique Rings Tweaked by Aleist3r

Simple bugfix for unique rings.

Part of May Modathon Month
This mod simply fixes mesh error artifact rings carry over from exquisite_ring_01 model. Also, replaces model for exquisite_ring_02 to be distinguishable from its 01 counterpart ( vanilla uses c_ring_exquisite_1.nif for both of them).
