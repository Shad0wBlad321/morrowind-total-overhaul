--------------------------------
Плагин изменяет черные текстуры колец на цветные. В игру не внесено никаких изменений.
-unzip to C:\Program Files\Bethesda Softworks\Morrowind\Data Files
(Don't forget to run Morrowind Launcher and put a check in the box next to Ring Texture Fix)
--------------------------------

What does this plugin do?

-It Fixes the black ring textures to the colorful textures that Bethseda intended you to see.
-All rings will have textures now, including enchanted rings.
-The "glow effect" that enchanted rings HAS NOT been altered or changed.
-A plugin was required, dropping the textures in the appropiate files did not fix the problem.
-Have a look at the Before & After jpeg if you don't quite understand what this plugin does.
-The Before & After jpeg can be deleted.
--------------------------------

e-mail me if you have questions,comments,problems or if you come across any rings that still have a dark black texture to them, but i am sure they all have textures now.

enjoy!
